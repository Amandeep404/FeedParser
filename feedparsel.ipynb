       "  'summary': '<p><em>I\\'m new to AWS os please take the following statements with a grain of salt. Also, I\\'m tired, but I want to get this of\\nmy chest before the weekend begins (although, technically, it has already begun), so it might not be so coherent.</em></p>\\n<p>AWS provides some minimum monitoring of your resources with a tool called CloudWatch. Think of prometheus + grafana, but\\nmore limited. Still, is good enough to the point it makes sense to setup some Alerts on it. Many of AWS\\'s resources are\\nnot processes running on a computer you have access to, so you can\\'t always install some exporters and do the monitoring\\nyourself.</p>\\n<p>If you\\'re like me, CloudWatch Alerts must be sent to the outside world so you can receive them and react. One way to do\\nthis<sup id=\"fnref:1\"><a class=\"footnote-ref\" href=\"https://www.grulic.org.ar/~mdione/glob/posts/sending-aws-cloudwatch-alarms-through-sns-to-msteams/#fn:1\">1</a></sup> is to channel them through SNS. SNS supports many protocols, most of them internal to AWS, but also HTTP/S. SNS\\nis a pub-sub system, and requires a little bit of protocol before it works.</p>\\n<p>On the other end we<sup id=\"fnref:2\"><a class=\"footnote-ref\" href=\"https://www.grulic.org.ar/~mdione/glob/posts/sending-aws-cloudwatch-alarms-through-sns-to-msteams/#fn:2\">2</a></sup> have MSTeams<sup id=\"fnref:3\"><a class=\"footnote-ref\" href=\"https://www.grulic.org.ar/~mdione/glob/posts/sending-aws-cloudwatch-alarms-through-sns-to-msteams/#fn:3\">3</a></sup>. MSTeams has many ways of communicating. One is Chat, which is a crappy chat<sup id=\"fnref:6\"><a class=\"footnote-ref\" href=\"https://www.grulic.org.ar/~mdione/glob/posts/sending-aws-cloudwatch-alarms-through-sns-to-msteams/#fn:6\">6</a></sup><sup id=\"fnref:7\"><a class=\"footnote-ref\" href=\"https://www.grulic.org.ar/~mdione/glob/posts/sending-aws-cloudwatch-alarms-through-sns-to-msteams/#fn:7\">7</a></sup>,\\nand another is some kind of\\nmix between a blog and twitter, confusingly called Teams. The idea in a Team is that you can post... Posts? Articles? And\\nfrom them you can have an unthreaded converstion. Only Teams have webhooks; Chats do not, so you can\\'t point SNS there.</p>\\n<p>If you have read other articles about integrating CloudWatch Alerts or SNS to MSTeams, they will always tell you that\\nyou not only need SNS, but also a Lambda program. Since we already handle gazillion servers, not all of them in AWS, and\\none in particular we pay quite cheap for dedicated HW, and also we\\'re trying to slim our AWS bill (who doesn\\'t), I\\ndecided to see if I can build my own bridge between SNS and Teams.</p>\\n<p>I already said that SNS has a litte protocol. The idea is that when you create an HTTP/S Subscription in SNS, it will\\n<code>POST</code> a first message to the URL you define. This message will have a JSON payload. We\\'re interested in two fields:</p>\\n<div class=\"code\"><pre class=\"code literal-block\"><span class=\"p\">{</span>\\n<span class=\"w\">    </span><span class=\"nt\">\"Type\"</span><span class=\"p\">:</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"s2\">\"SubscriptionConfirmation\"</span><span class=\"p\">,</span>\\n<span class=\"w\">    </span><span class=\"nt\">\"SubscribeURL\"</span><span class=\"p\">:</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"s2\">\"...\"</span>\\n<span class=\"p\">}</span>\\n</pre></div>\\n\\n<p>What you have to do is get this URL and call it. That way SNS will know the endpoint exists and will associate an ARN to\\nthe Subscription. Otherwise, the Subscription will stay unconfirmed and no messages will be sent to it. Interestingly,\\nyou can\\'t neither edit nor remove Subscriptions (at least not with the web interface), and I read that unconfirmed\\nSubscriptions will disappear after 3 days or so <sup id=\"fnref:4\"><a class=\"footnote-ref\" href=\"https://www.grulic.org.ar/~mdione/glob/posts/sending-aws-cloudwatch-alarms-through-sns-to-msteams/#fn:4\">4</a></sup>.</p>\\n<p>SNS messages are also a JSON payload <code>POST</code>\\'ed to the URL.

Notice that the\\nregion is not the codename as in <code>eu-west-1</code> but a supposedly more human readable text. The rest is mostly info about the\\nAlarm itself. Also notice the <code>Dimensions</code> field. I don\\'t know what other data comes here (probably the arbitrary fields\\nand values you can setup in the Alarm), all I can say is that that format (list of dicts with only two fields, one called\\n<code>name</code> and the other <code>value</code>) is possibly the most annoying implementation of a simple dict. I hope they have a reason\\nfor that, besides over engineering.</p>\\n<p>Finally, notice that the only info we get here about the source of the alarm is the <code>InstanceId</code>. As those are random\\nstrings, to me they don\\'t mean anything. Maybe I can setup the Alarm so it also includes the instance\\'a name<sup id=\"fnref:5\"><a class=\"footnote-ref\" href=\"https://www.grulic.org.ar/~mdione/glob/posts/sending-aws-cloudwatch-alarms-through-sns-to-msteams/#fn:5\">5</a></sup>, and\\neven maybe the URL pointing to the metric\\'s graph.</p>\\n<p>Finally, Teams\\' webhook also expects a JSON payload. I didn\\'t delve much in what you can give to it, I just used the\\n<code>title</code>, <code>text</code> and <code>themeColor</code> fields. At least <code>text</code> can be written in MarkDown. You get such a webhook going to the Team,\\nclick in the <code>⋮</code> (\"vertical ellipsis\") icon, \"Connectors\", add a webhook and obtain the URL from there. <code>@type</code> and\\n<code>@context</code> I copied from an SNS-to-Lambda-to-Teams post.</p>\\n<p>So to build a bridge between CloudWatch Alerts through SNS to MSTeams\\'s Team we just need a quite straightforward\\nscript. I decided to write it in Flask, but I\\'m pretty sure writing it in plain <code>http.server</code> and <code>urllib.request</code>\\nto avoid dependencies is not much more work; I just didn\\'t want to do it. Maybe I should have tried FastAPI instead;\\nI simply forgot about it.</p>\\n<p>Without further ado, here\\'s the script. I\\'m running Python 3.8, so I don\\'t have <code>case</code>/<code>match</code> yet.</p>\\n<div class=\"code\"><pre class=\"code literal-block\"><span class=\"ch\">#! /usr/bin/env

One way to do\\nthis<sup id=\"fnref:1\"><a class=\"footnote-ref\" href=\"https://www.grulic.org.ar/~mdione/glob/posts/sending-aws-cloudwatch-alarms-through-sns-to-msteams/#fn:1\">1</a></sup> is to channel them through SNS. SNS supports many protocols, most of them internal to AWS, but also HTTP/S. SNS\\nis a pub-sub system, and requires a little bit of protocol before it works.</p>\\n<p>On the other end we<sup id=\"fnref:2\"><a class=\"footnote-ref\" href=\"https://www.grulic.org.ar/~mdione/glob/posts/sending-aws-cloudwatch-alarms-through-sns-to-msteams/#fn:2\">2</a></sup> have MSTeams<sup id=\"fnref:3\"><a class=\"footnote-ref\" href=\"https://www.grulic.org.ar/~mdione/glob/posts/sending-aws-cloudwatch-alarms-through-sns-to-msteams/#fn:3\">3</a></sup>. MSTeams has many ways of communicating. One is Chat, which is a crappy chat<sup id=\"fnref:6\"><a class=\"footnote-ref\" href=\"https://www.grulic.org.ar/~mdione/glob/posts/sending-aws-cloudwatch-alarms-through-sns-to-msteams/#fn:6\">6</a></sup><sup id=\"fnref:7\"><a class=\"footnote-ref\" href=\"https://www.grulic.org.ar/~mdione/glob/posts/sending-aws-cloudwatch-alarms-through-sns-to-msteams/#fn:7\">7</a></sup>,\\nand another is some kind of\\nmix between a blog and twitter, confusingly called Teams. The idea in a Team is that you can post... Posts? Articles? And\\nfrom them you can have an unthreaded converstion. Only Teams have webhooks; Chats do not, so you can\\'t point SNS there.</p>\\n<p>If you have read other articles about integrating CloudWatch Alerts or SNS to MSTeams, they will always tell you that\\nyou not only need SNS, but also a Lambda program. Since we already handle gazillion servers, not all of them in AWS, and\\none in particular we pay quite cheap for dedicated HW, and also we\\'re trying to slim our AWS bill (who doesn\\'t), I\\ndecided to see if I can build my own bridge between SNS and Teams.</p>\\n<p>I already said that SNS has a litte protocol. The idea is that when you create an HTTP/S Subscription in SNS, it will\\n<code>POST</code> a first message to the URL you define. This message will have a JSON payload. We\\'re interested in two fields:</p>\\n<div class=\"code\"><pre class=\"code literal-block\"><span class=\"p\">{</span>\\n<span class=\"w\">    </span><span class=\"nt\">\"Type\"</span><span class=\"p\">:</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"s2\">\"SubscriptionConfirmation\"</span><span class=\"p\">,</span>\\n<span class=\"w\">    </span><span class=\"nt\">\"SubscribeURL\"</span><span class=\"p\">:</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"s2\">\"...\"</span>\\n<span class=\"p\">}</span>\\n</pre></div>\\n\\n<p>What you have to do is get this URL and call it. That way SNS will know the endpoint exists and will associate an ARN to\\nthe Subscription. Otherwise, the Subscription will stay unconfirmed and no messages will be sent to it. Interestingly,\\nyou can\\'t neither edit nor remove Subscriptions (at least not with the web interface), and I read that unconfirmed\\nSubscriptions will disappear after 3 days or so <sup id=\"fnref:4\"><a class=\"footnote-ref\" href=\"https://www.grulic.org.ar/~mdione/glob/posts/sending-aws-cloudwatch-alarms-through-sns-to-msteams/#fn:4\">4</a></sup>.</p>\\n<p>SNS messages are also a JSON payload <code>POST</code>\\'ed to the URL. They look like this:</p>\\n<div class=\"code\"><pre class=\"code literal-block\"><span class=\"p\">{</span>\\n<span class=\"w\">  </span><span class=\"nt\">\"Type\"</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"p\">:</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"s2\">\"Notification\"</span><span class=\"p\">,</span>\\n<span class=\"w\">  </span><span class=\"nt\">\"MessageId\"</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"p\">:</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"s2\">\"&lt;uuid1&gt;\"</span><span class=\"p\">,</span>\\n<span class=\"w\">  </span><span class=\"nt\">\"TopicArn\"</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"p\">:</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"s2\">\"&lt;arn&gt;\"</span><span class=\"p\">,</span>\\n<span class=\"w\">  </span><span class=\"nt\">\"Subject\"</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"p\">:</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"s2\">\"...\"</span><span class=\"p\">,</span>\\n<span class=\"w\">  </span><span class=\"nt\">\"Message\"</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"p\">:</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"s2\">\"...\"</span><span class=\"p\">,</span>\\n<span class=\"w\">  </span><span class=\"nt\">\"Timestamp\"</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"p\">:</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"s2\">\"2024-01-19T14:29:54.147Z\"</span><span class=\"p\">,</span>\\n<span class=\"w\">  </span><span class=\"nt\">\"SignatureVersion\"</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"p\">:</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"s2\">\"1\"</span><span class=\"p\">,</span>\\n<span class=\"w\">  </span><span class=\"nt\">\"Signature\"</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"p\">:</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"s2\">\"cTQUWntlQW5evk/bZ5lkhSdWj2+4oa/4eApdgkcdebegX3Dvwpq786Zi6lZbxGsjof2C+XMt4rV9xM1DBlsVq6tsBQvkfzGBzOvwerZZ7j4Sfy/GTJvtS4L2x/OVUCLleY3ULSCRYX2H1TTTanK44tOU5f8W+8AUz1DKRT+qL+T2fWqmUrPYSK452j/rPZcZaVwZnNaYkroPmJmI4gxjr/37Q6gA8sK+WyC0U91/MDKHpuAmCAXrhgrJIpEX/1t2mNlnlbJpcsR9h05tHJNkQEkPwFY0HFTnyGvTM2DP6Ep7C2z83/OHeVJ6pa7Sn3txVWR5AQC1PF8UbT7zdGJL9Q==\"</span><span class=\"p\">,</span>\\n<span class=\"w\">  </span><span class=\"nt\">\"SigningCertURL\"</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"p\">:</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"s2\">\"https://sns.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/SimpleNotificationService-01d088a6f77103d0fe307c0069e40ed6.pem\"</span><span class=\"p\">,</span>\\n<span class=\"w\">  </span><span class=\"nt\">\"UnsubscribeURL\"</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"p\">:</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"s2\">\"https://sns.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/?Action=Unsubscribe&amp;SubscriptionArn=&lt;arn&gt;:&lt;uuid2&gt;\"</span>\\n<span class=\"p\">}</span>\\n</pre></div>\\n\\n<p>Now, CloudWatch Alerts sent via SNS are sent in the <code>Message</code> field.

Notice that the\\nregion is not the codename as in <code>eu-west-1</code> but a supposedly more human readable text. The rest is mostly info about the\\nAlarm itself. Also notice the <code>Dimensions</code> field. I don\\'t know what other data comes here (probably the arbitrary fields\\nand values you can setup in the Alarm), all I can say is that that format (list of dicts with only two fields, one called\\n<code>name</code> and the other <code>value</code>) is possibly the most annoying implementation of a simple dict. I hope they have a reason\\nfor that, besides over engineering.</p>\\n<p>Finally, notice that the only info we get here about the source of the alarm is the <code>InstanceId</code>. As those are random\\nstrings, to me they don\\'t mean anything. Maybe I can setup the Alarm so it also includes the instance\\'a name<sup id=\"fnref:5\"><a class=\"footnote-ref\" href=\"https://www.grulic.org.ar/~mdione/glob/posts/sending-aws-cloudwatch-alarms-through-sns-to-msteams/#fn:5\">5</a></sup>, and\\neven maybe the URL pointing to the metric\\'s graph.</p>\\n<p>Finally, Teams\\' webhook also expects a JSON payload. I didn\\'t delve much in what you can give to it, I just used the\\n<code>title</code>, <code>text</code> and <code>themeColor</code> fields. At least <code>text</code> can be written in MarkDown. You get such a webhook going to the Team,\\nclick in the <code>⋮</code> (\"vertical ellipsis\") icon, \"Connectors\", add a webhook and obtain the URL from there. <code>@type</code> and\\n<code>@context</code> I copied from an SNS-to-Lambda-to-Teams post.</p>\\n<p>So to build a bridge between CloudWatch Alerts through SNS to MSTeams\\'s Team we just need a quite straightforward\\nscript. I decided to write it in Flask, but I\\'m pretty sure writing it in plain <code>http.server</code> and <code>urllib.request</code>\\nto avoid dependencies is not much more work; I just didn\\'t want to do it. Maybe I should have tried FastAPI instead;\\nI simply forgot about it.</p>\\n<p>Without further ado, here\\'s the script.

It offers valuable insights into the program and explains why your participation is integral.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Join us in the coming weeks to explore the new features in PyCharm, test them out, and provide feedback on the new additions. Your engagement is what helps us shape the evolution of PyCharm.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"user-experience\">User experience&nbsp;</h2>\\n\\n\\n\\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"option-to-scale-down-the-entire-ide\">Option to scale down the entire IDE</h3>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>PyCharm 2023.1 introduced the ability to zoom in and out of the entire IDE, adjusting the size of all UI elements simultaneously. However, the initial scaling range was limited to between 100 and 200%. In PyCharm 2024.1 EAP 1, we have incorporated a new option allowing users to scale down the IDE to 90%, 80%, or 70%, offering an extended range of customization options.&nbsp;</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<img src=\"https://blog.jetbrains.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/2024_1_zoom.png\" />\\n\\n\\n\\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><em>Django Structure</em> tool window</h2>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>This first build also brings multiple improvements to the recently introduced <em>Django Structure</em> tool window.

Instead of typing out\\ncode by hand every step of the way, you are essentially directing someone else to work\\nthrough the details of manageable steps in the software development process.</p>\\n<p><a class=\"reference\" href=\"http://wingware.com/doc/ai\">Read More</a></p>\\n</div>\\n<div class=\"section\">\\n<h3 class=\"title-3\">Support for Python 3.12</h3>\\n<p>Wing 10 adds support for Python 3.12, including (1) faster debugging with PEP 669 low impact\\nmonitoring API, (2) PEP 695 parameterized classes, functions and methods, (3) PEP 695 type\\nstatements, and (4) PEP 701 style f-strings.

This transforms the residency program into a full blown team! We couldn’t be happier.<br /><br />It’s exciting to be able to begin to realize the full vision of the Developers in Residence program, with special thanks to Bloomberg for making it possible for us to bring Petr on board. The initial idea behind the Developer in Residence was to have three to five people hired directly by the Python Software Foundation to help with developer efficiency at CPython, where most of the contributors are volunteers. Three to five people is a good amount to allow for handling both day-to-day tasks, as well as planning and executing on larger-scale projects.<br /><br />We were only able to start with a single Developer in Residence, initially sponsored by Google for the initial year, and by Meta for the following two years. We were <a href=\"https://pyfound.blogspot.com/2023/02/the-case-for-second-developer-in.html\">clear that adding more developers in residence would multiply the impact of the role</a> but, of course, the big question is funding. Fortunately, the success of the initial one-person program allowed for a new sponsor to participate, interested in extending the program with another developer. Thank you, Bloomberg!<br /><br />We <a href=\"https://lukasz.langa.pl/40b601fc-2b24-4629-91d9-3b32c58365c6/\">announced</a> the job opening back in July, and the interview process was extensive. The Foundation received close to 100 applications, and it was a very tough decision, as most were excellent candidates. One surprise in particular was that despite the Deputy role being described as targeting programmers of various experience levels, we received many more applications from Python core developers than during the initial Developer in Residence job opening.<br /><br />Naturally, the core developers bubbled up in the interview process. We were especially impressed by Petr Viktorin’s experience with maintaining Python at Red Hat, his interest in the C API, and his long-term existing contributions to Python. Given the transformative recent developments inside the interpreter in terms of performance and scalability, Petr’s skillset was the perfect match. We’re excited he accepted the offer!<br /><br />However, there was one more person who we were also ready to hire on the spot: Serhiy Storchaka, a rare example of a core developer generalist, with plenty of C experience and contributions across the entire codebase. Consistently one of the top most prolific contributors to Python, we felt like we needed to secure him as a member for the Residents team. Unexpectedly, a generous anonymous donation allowed us to hire Serhiy as well. Thank you!<br /><br />We are calling the role the Supporting Developer in Residence to make it clear the funding level here isn’t as high as in the Deputy case. Please contact us if your organization can help sponsor Serhiy to bump him to the Deputy salary. Serhiy sure deserves it!<br /><br />After an initial meeting with the Steering Council, the Residents team is now ready to take on a more active role in shaping the development of the language. The Council advised that while every team member is expected to prioritize unblocking other contributors and keeping the developer experience smooth, with three people on the team each Resident can now also spend a percentage of their time on feature work aligned with their interests.<br /><br />There are some exciting times ahead for Python!<br /><br />',\n",

       "  'summary': '<p><span>We are pleased to announce the return of the Hatchery program in PyCon US 2024.</span></p><h2>What is the Hatchery program?</h2><p>This program offers the pathways for PyCon US attendees to introduce new tracks, activities, summits, demos, etc., at PyCon US—activities that all share and fulfill the <a href=\"https://www.python.org/psf/mission/\" target=\"_blank\">Python Software Foundation’s mission</a> within the PyCon US schedule.</p><p>The program began as a trial led by Ee Durbin and Naomi Ceder in 2018, resulting in the creation of several new tracks that are now staples of PyCon US, for example: PyCon US Charlas, Mentored Sprints, and Maintainer’s Summit.</p><p>The Hatchery program was paused during the pandemic, and we are excited to restart and refresh this program for PyCon US 2024.</p><p>With the Hatchery program, we want to provide the opportunity for you, the Python community members, to take active participation and lead new activities and events at PyCon US. We want to provide a transparent process for this, and we also want to ensure that every attendee, whether they are new to the community, or have been at the conference for the 10th time, have the equal opportunity to propose ideas for PyCon US.</p><h2>What belongs in a Hatchery program</h2><p>PyCon US offers a wide range of events for the attendees to engage with the community during the conference. In addition to the talks, Charlas, keynotes, tutorials, posters, and lightning talks, at PyCon US we further support the Python community by hosting summits (e.g. The Python Language Summit, Education Summit), Sprints, and Open Spaces: one-hour meet ups in dedicated rooms throughout the conference. PyCon US also hosts other events like the PyLadies Luncheon, Members Lunch, and PyLadies Auction. We also offer community booths and Startup Row alongside the Sponsor Booths in the expo hall.</p><p>Despite all of the above, as conference organizers we still receive great, creative suggestions and ideas from the community for more things that they’d like to see at PyCon US. This is where the Hatchery program comes in.</p><p>If you have an idea for new and different kinds of events, activities, summits, or tracks at PyCon US, or things that do not fit in any of the existing talks, charlas, tutorials, and posters tracks, please propose that as a Hatchery.</p><p>A few examples of  topics that have been accepted for the program (not a complete list, creativity is expressly encouraged):</p><p></p><ul><li><a href=\"https://us.pycon.org/2023/events/maintainers-summit/\" target=\"_blank\">Maintainers\\' Summit</a></li><li><a href=\"https://us.pycon.org/2020/hatchery/artofpython/\" target=\"_blank\">The Art of Python</a></li><li>Foreign language talk track (see the <a href=\"https://us.pycon.org/2020/speaking/charlas/\" target=\"_blank\">PyCon US Charlas</a>, the first track created in the hatchery, and now a part of PyCon US).</li><li>Scientific data summit</li><li><a href=\"https://us.pycon.org/2023/events/mentored-sprints/\" target=\"_blank\">Mentored Sprints</a></li></ul><p></p><p>See the full guidelines and criteria for proposals at&nbsp;<a href=\"https://us.pycon.org/2024/events/hatchery/\">https://us.pycon.org/2024/events/hatchery/</a></p><h2>Hatchery Program Rebooted!</h2><p>Since it’s been a few years since the last time the Hatchery program ran, meaning, some folks might have already forgotten about it, and newer community members might not yet know what it’s about.

We want to provide a transparent process for this, and we also want to ensure that every attendee, whether they are new to the community, or have been at the conference for the 10th time, have the equal opportunity to propose ideas for PyCon US.</p><h2>What belongs in a Hatchery program</h2><p>PyCon US offers a wide range of events for the attendees to engage with the community during the conference. In addition to the talks, Charlas, keynotes, tutorials, posters, and lightning talks, at PyCon US we further support the Python community by hosting summits (e.g. The Python Language Summit, Education Summit), Sprints, and Open Spaces: one-hour meet ups in dedicated rooms throughout the conference. PyCon US also hosts other events like the PyLadies Luncheon, Members Lunch, and PyLadies Auction. We also offer community booths and Startup Row alongside the Sponsor Booths in the expo hall.</p><p>Despite all of the above, as conference organizers we still receive great, creative suggestions and ideas from the community for more things that they’d like to see at PyCon US. This is where the Hatchery program comes in.</p><p>If you have an idea for new and different kinds of events, activities, summits, or tracks at PyCon US, or things that do not fit in any of the existing talks, charlas, tutorials, and posters tracks, please propose that as a Hatchery.</p><p>A few examples of  topics that have been accepted for the program (not a complete list, creativity is expressly encouraged):</p><p></p><ul><li><a href=\"https://us.pycon.org/2023/events/maintainers-summit/\" target=\"_blank\">Maintainers\\' Summit</a></li><li><a href=\"https://us.pycon.org/2020/hatchery/artofpython/\" target=\"_blank\">The Art of Python</a></li><li>Foreign language talk track (see the <a href=\"https://us.pycon.org/2020/speaking/charlas/\" target=\"_blank\">PyCon US Charlas</a>, the first track created in the hatchery, and now a part of PyCon US).</li><li>Scientific data summit</li><li><a href=\"https://us.pycon.org/2023/events/mentored-sprints/\" target=\"_blank\">Mentored Sprints</a></li></ul><p></p><p>See the full guidelines and criteria for proposals at&nbsp;<a href=\"https://us.pycon.org/2024/events/hatchery/\">https://us.pycon.org/2024/events/hatchery/</a></p><h2>Hatchery Program Rebooted!</h2><p>Since it’s been a few years since the last time the Hatchery program ran, meaning, some folks might have already forgotten about it, and newer community members might not yet know what it’s about. With that in mind we decided that this is a good time for us to introduce some changes to the Hatchery program.</p><h3>One-off events are encouraged!</h3><p>Previous versions of the Hatchery prioritized programs that have potential to become a new staple and repeat program at PyCon US, and one-off events were given a lower priority.

This is a doctored version of the free <a href=\"https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/dreb87/jamesbond/data\">James Bond Movie Dataset</a>. The <code>james_bond_data.csv</code> file contains a subset of the original data with some of the records altered to make them suitable for this tutorial. You’ll find it in the downloadable materials. Once you have your data file, you’re ready to begin your first mission into data analysis.</p>\\n<h2 id=\"understanding-the-need-for-a-data-analysis-workflow\">Understanding the Need for a Data Analysis Workflow<a class=\"headerlink\" href=\"https://realpython.com/atom.xml#understanding-the-need-for-a-data-analysis-workflow\" title=\"Permanent link\"></a></h2>\\n<p>Data analysis is a very popular field and can involve performing many different tasks of varying complexity. Which specific analysis steps you perform will depend on which dataset you’re analyzing and what information you hope to glean. To overcome these scope and complexity issues, you need to take a strategic approach when performing your analysis. This is where a <strong>data analysis workflow</strong> can help you.</p>\\n<p>A data analysis workflow is a process that provides a set of steps for your analysis team to follow when analyzing data. The implementation of each of these steps will vary depending on the nature of your analysis, but following an agreed-upon workflow allows everyone involved to know what needs to happen and to see how the project is progressing.</p>\\n<p>Using a workflow also helps futureproof your analysis methodology. By following the defined set of steps, your efforts become systematic, which minimizes the possibility that you’ll make mistakes or miss something. Furthermore, when you carefully document your work, you can reapply your procedures against future data as it becomes available. Data analysis workflows therefore also provide repeatability and scalability.</p>\\n<p>There’s no single data workflow process that suits every analysis, nor is there universal terminology for the procedures used within it. To provide a structure for the rest of this tutorial, the diagram below illustrates the stages that you’ll commonly find in most workflows:</p>\\n<a href=\"https://files.realpython.com/media/ie-data-analysis-workflowv3.bfb835b95c5e.png\" target=\"_blank\"><img alt=\"diagram of a data analysis workflow with iterations\" class=\"img-fluid mx-auto d-block \" height=\"569\" src=\"https://files.realpython.com/media/ie-data-analysis-workflowv3.bfb835b95c5e.png\" width=\"1292\" /></a>A Data Analysis Workflow\\n\\n<p>The solid arrows show the standard data analysis workflow that you’ll work through to learn what happens at each stage. The dashed arrows indicate where you may need to carry out some of the individual steps several times depending upon the success of your analysis. Indeed, you may even have to repeat the entire process should your first analysis reveal something interesting that demands further attention.</p>\\n<p>Now that you have an understanding of the need for a data analysis workflow, you’ll work through its steps and perform an analysis of movie data. The movies that you’ll analyze all relate to the British secret agent Bond … <em>James Bond.</em></p>\\n<h2 id=\"setting-your-objectives\">Setting Your Objectives<a class=\"headerlink\" href=\"https://realpython.com/atom.xml#setting-your-objectives\" title=\"Permanent link\"></a></h2>\\n<p>The very first workflow step in data analysis is to carefully but clearly define your objectives. It’s vitally important for you and your analysis team to be clear on what exactly you’re all trying to achieve. This step doesn’t involve any programming but is every bit as important because, without an understanding of where you want to go, you’re unlikely to ever get there.</p>\\n<p>The objectives of your data analysis will vary depending on what you’re analyzing. Your team leader may want to know why a new product hasn’t sold, or perhaps your government wants information about a clinical test of a new medical drug. You may even be asked to make investment recommendations based on the past results of a particular financial instrument. Regardless, you must still be clear on your objectives. These define your scope.</p>\\n<p>In this tutorial, you’ll gain experience in data analysis by having some fun with the James Bond movie dataset mentioned earlier. What are your objectives? <em>Now pay attention, 007</em>:</p>\\n<ul>\\n<li>Is there any relationship between the Rotten Tomatoes ratings and those from IMDb?</li>\\n<li>Are there any insights to be gleaned from analyzing the lengths of the movies?</li>\\n<li>Is there a relationship between the number of enemies James Bond has killed and the user ratings of the movie in which they were killed?</li>\\n</ul>\\n<p>Now that you’ve been briefed on your mission, it’s time to get out into the field and see what intelligence you can uncover.</p>\\n<h2 id=\"acquiring-your-data\">Acquiring Your Data<a class=\"headerlink\" href=\"https://realpython.com/atom.xml#acquiring-your-data\" title=\"Permanent link\"></a></h2>\\n<p>Once you’ve established your objectives, your next step is to think about what data you’ll need to achieve them. Hopefully, this data will be readily available, but you may have to work hard to get it. You may need to extract it from the data storage systems within an organization or <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Survey_data_collection\">collect survey data</a>. Regardless, you’ll somehow need to get the data.</p>\\n<p>In this case, you’re in luck. When your bosses briefed you on your objectives, they also gave you the data in the <code>james_bond_data.csv</code> file. You must now spend some time becoming familiar with what you have in front of you. During the briefing, you made some notes on the content of this file:</p>\\n<div class=\"table-responsive\">\\n<table class=\"table table-hover\">\\n<thead>\\n<tr>\\n<th>Heading</th>\\n<th>Meaning</th>\\n</tr>\\n</thead>\\n<tbody>\\n<tr>\\n<td><code>Release</code></td>\\n<td>The release date of the movie</td>\\n</tr>\\n<tr>\\n<td><code>Movie</code></td>\\n<td>The title of the movie</td>\\n</tr>\\n<tr>\\n<td><code>Bond</code></td>\\n<td>The actor playing the title role</td>\\n</tr>\\n<tr>\\n<td><code>Bond_Car_MFG</code></td>\\n<td>The manufacturer of James Bond’s car</td>\\n</tr>\\n<tr>\\n<td><code>US_Gross</code></td>\\n<td>The movie’s gross US earnings</td>\\n</tr>\\n<tr>\\n<td><code>World_Gross</code></td>\\n<td>The movie’s gross worldwide earnings</td>\\n</tr>\\n<tr>\\n<td><code>Budget ($ 000s)</code></td>\\n<td>The movie’s budget, in thousands of US dollars</td>\\n</tr>\\n<tr>\\n<td><code>Film_Length</code></td>\\n<td>The running time of the movie</td>\\n</tr>\\n<tr>\\n<td><code>Avg_User_IMDB</code></td>\\n<td>The average user rating from IMDb</td>\\n</tr>\\n<tr>\\n<td><code>Avg_User_Rtn_Tom</code></td>\\n<td>The average user rating from Rotten Tomatoes</td>\\n</tr>\\n<tr>\\n<td><code>Martinis</code></td>\\n<td>The number of martinis that Bond drank in the movie</td>\\n</tr>\\n</tbody>\\n</table>\\n</div>\\n<p>As you can see, you have quite a variety of data.

Correct format is <code>{name}-{version}</code>.</li>\\n<li>Use the <code>fileName</code> attribute on the CPython package instead of using a separate file component for the tarball containing CPython source code.</li>\\n<li>Include an email address for all \"Person\" identities.</li>\\n<li>Guidance on alternatives to the <code>documentNamespace</code> field.</li>\\n</ul>\\n\\n<p>After applying this feedback we now have an SBOM which meets <a href=\"https://www.ntia.doc.gov/files/ntia/publications/sbom_minimum_elements_report.pdf\">NTIA\\'s Minimum Elements of an SBOM</a>\\nand scores 9.6 out of 10 for the <a href=\"https://sbombenchmark.dev/\">SBOM Quality Score</a>.</p>\\n\\n<p>Next I\\'m working on the infrastructure for actually generating and making the SBOM available for consumers:</p>\\n\\n<ul>\\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/python/release-tools/pull/82\">Created a PR</a> for generating the draft SBOM. Next need to hook into the actual release process and opportunistically generate an SBOM.</li>\\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/python/release-tools/pull/82/commits/9b1fdfa9605a9e71ff32333cb2e71ad3304ceed6\">Applied changes</a> according to feedback from SBOM reviewers.</li>\\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/python/pythondotorg/pull/2359\">Created a PR</a> for enabling hosting an SBOM artifact on <a href=\"https://python.org/downloads\">https://python.org/downloads</a></li>\\n</ul>\\n\\n<h2>Other items</h2>\\n\\n<ul>\\n<li>Reviewed <a href=\"https://github.com/python/peps/pull/3618\">PEP 740 proposal</a> for arbitrary attestation mechanism for PyPI artifacts.</li>\\n<li>Triaged multiple reports to the Python Security Response Team.</li>\\n</ul>\\n\\n<p>That\\'s all for this week! 👋 If you\\'re interested in more you can read <a href=\"https://sethmlarson.dev/security-developer-in-residence-weekly-report-24\">last week\\'s report</a>.</p>\\n\\n<blockquote>\\n    <p>\\n        <strong>Thanks for reading!</strong> ♡ Did you find this article helpful and want more content like it?\\n        Get notified of new posts by subscribing to the <a href=\"http://sethmlarson.dev/feed\">RSS feed</a> or the <a href=\"https://buttondown.email/sethmlarson\">email newsletter</a>.\\n    <form action=\"https://buttondown.email/api/emails/embed-subscribe/sethmlarson\" method=\"post\" target=\"popupwindow\">\\n        <input id=\"bd-email\" name=\"email\" type=\"email\" />\\n    <input type=\"submit\" value=\"Subscribe\" />\\n    </form>\\n    </p>\\n</blockquote>\\n<div>\\n    <center>\\n         <p>This work is licensed under <a href=\"https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/?ref=chooser-v1\" rel=\"license noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">CC BY-SA 4.0</a> <a href=\"https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/?ref=chooser-v1\" rel=\"license noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><img src=\"https://mirrors.creativecommons.org/presskit/icons/cc.svg?ref=chooser-v1\" /><img src=\"https://mirrors.creativecommons.org/presskit/icons/by.svg?ref=chooser-v1\" /><img src=\"https://mirrors.creativecommons.org/presskit/icons/sa.svg?ref=chooser-v1\" /></a></p>\\n    </center>\\n</div>\\n\\n\\n</div>'},\n",

class=\"headerlink\">&nbsp;<a href=\"https://death.andgravity.com/lru-cache#requirements\" title=\"permalink\">#</a></span></h2>\\n<p>So you\\'re at an interview and\\nhave to implement a <em>priority-expiry LRU cache</em>.</p>\\n<p>Maybe you get more details,\\nbut maybe the problem is deliberately vague;\\neither way,\\nwe can reconstruct the requirements from the name alone.</p>\\n<p>A <em>cache</em> is something that stores data\\nfor future reuse,\\nusually the result of a slow computation or retrieval.\\nEach piece of data has an associated <em>key</em>\\nused to retrieve it.\\nMost caches are <em>bounded</em> in some way,\\nfor example by limiting the number of items.</p>\\n<p>The other words have to do with <em>eviction</em>\\n– how and when items are removed.</p>\\n<ul>\\n<li>Each item has a <em>priority</em> –\\nwhen the cache fills up,\\nwe evict items with the lowest priority first.</li>\\n<li>Each item has a maximum age –\\nif it\\'s older than that,\\nit is <em>expired</em>,\\nso we don\\'t return it to the user.\\nIt stands to reason expired items are evicted\\nregardless of their priority or how full the cache is.</li>\\n<li>All other things being equal,\\nwe evict items <em>least recently used</em>\\nrelative to others.</li>\\n</ul>\\n<p>The problem may specify an API;\\nwe can reconstruct that from first principles too.\\nSince the cache is basically a key-value store,\\nwe can get away with two methods:</p>\\n<ul>\\n<li><code>set(key, value, maxage, priority)</code></li>\\n<li><code>get(key) -&gt; value or None</code></li>\\n</ul>\\n<p>The problem may also suggest:</p>\\n<ul>\\n<li><code>delete(key)</code> – allows users to invalidate items\\nfor reasons external to the cache;\\nnot strictly necessary,\\nbut we\\'ll end up with it as part of refactoring</li>\\n<li><code>evict(now)</code> – not strictly necessary either,\\nbut hints eviction is a separate bit of logic,\\nand may come in handy for testing</li>\\n</ul>\\n<p>Types deserve their own discussion:</p>\\n<ul>\\n<li><code>key</code> – usually, the key is a string,\\nbut we can relax this to any <a class=\"external\" href=\"https://docs.python.org/3/glossary.html#term-hashable\">hashable</a> value</li>\\n<li><code>value</code> – for an in-memory cache, any kind of object is fine</li>\\n<li><code>maxage</code> and <code>priority</code> – a number should do for these;\\na float is more general, but an integer may allow a simpler solution;\\nlimits on these are important too,\\nas we\\'ll see soon enough</li>\\n</ul>\\n\\n<p class=\"admonition-title\">Tip</p>\\n<p>Your interviewer may be expecting you to uncover some of these details\\n through clarifying questions.\\n Be sure to think out loud and state your assumptions.</p>\\n\\n<h2 id=\"a-minimal-plausible-solution\">A minimal plausible solution<span class=\"headerlink\">&nbsp;<a href=\"https://death.andgravity.com/lru-cache#a-minimal-plausible-solution\" title=\"permalink\">#</a></span></h2>\\n<p>I\\'m sure there are a lot smart people out there\\nthat can Think Really Hard™\\nand just come up with a solution,\\nbut I\\'m not one of them,\\nso we\\'ll take an iterative, <a class=\"external\" href=\"https://hintjens.gitbooks.io/scalable-c/content/chapter1.html#problem-what-do-we-do-next\">problem-solution</a> approach to this.</p>\\n<p>Since right now we don\\'t have <em>any</em> solution,\\nwe start with <a class=\"external\" href=\"https://wiki.c2.com/?DoTheSimplestThingThatCouldPossiblyWork\">the simplest thing that could possibly work</a><sup class=\"footnote-ref\" id=\"fnref-1\"><a href=\"https://death.andgravity.com/lru-cache#fn-1\">1</a></sup>\\n– a basic cache with no fancy eviction and no priorities;\\nwe can then write some tests against that,\\nto know if we break anything going forward.</p>\\n\\n<p class=\"admonition-title\">Tip</p>\\n<p>If during an interview you don\\'t know what to do\\n and choose to work up from the naive solution,\\n make it very clear that\\'s what you\\'re doing.\\n Your interviewer may give you hints to help you skip that.</p>\\n\\n<!-- ## setup -->\\n<p>A class holds all the things we need\\nand gives us something to stick the API on:</p>\\n<div class=\"highlight code-container\"><pre class=\"code\"><span></span><code><span class=\"k\">class</span> <span class=\"nc\">Cache</span><span class=\"p\">:</span>\\n\\n

This is somewhat counter-intuitive since it involves shifting a series of items in a list. But modern processors do this really well. A lot of time has been spent optimizing mem-copy/mem-move-like operations both in hardware and software.</p>\\n<p>But using only one list and <em>bisect.insort</em> would produce sluggish behavior for lengths exceeding ten thousand. So the implementation of <a class=\"external\" href=\"https://grantjenks.com/docs/sortedcontainers/sortedlist.html\">Sorted List</a> uses a list of lists to store elements. [...]</p>\\n</blockquote>\\n<p>There\\'s also a comparison with trees, which I\\'ll summarize:\\nfewer memory allocations,\\nbetter cache locality,\\nlower memory overhead,\\nand faster

Also, I\\'m tired, but I want to get this of\\nmy chest before the weekend begins (although, technically, it has already begun), so it might not be so coherent.</em></p>\\n<p>AWS provides some minimum monitoring of your resources with a tool called CloudWatch. Think of prometheus + grafana, but\\nmore limited. Still, is good enough to the point it makes sense to setup some Alerts on it. Many of AWS\\'s resources are\\nnot processes running on a computer you have access to, so you can\\'t always install some exporters and do the monitoring\\nyourself.</p>\\n<p>If you\\'re like me, CloudWatch Alerts must be sent to the outside world so you can receive them and react. One way to do\\nthis<sup id=\"fnref:1\"><a class=\"footnote-ref\" href=\"https://www.grulic.org.ar/~mdione/glob/posts/sending-aws-cloudwatch-alarms-through-sns-to-msteams/#fn:1\">1</a></sup> is to channel them through SNS. SNS supports many protocols, most of them internal to AWS, but also HTTP/S. SNS\\nis a pub-sub system, and requires a little bit of protocol before it works.</p>\\n<p>On the other end we<sup id=\"fnref:2\"><a class=\"footnote-ref\" href=\"https://www.grulic.org.ar/~mdione/glob/posts/sending-aws-cloudwatch-alarms-through-sns-to-msteams/#fn:2\">2</a></sup> have MSTeams<sup id=\"fnref:3\"><a class=\"footnote-ref\" href=\"https://www.grulic.org.ar/~mdione/glob/posts/sending-aws-cloudwatch-alarms-through-sns-to-msteams/#fn:3\">3</a></sup>. MSTeams has many ways of communicating. One is Chat, which is a crappy chat<sup id=\"fnref:6\"><a class=\"footnote-ref\" href=\"https://www.grulic.org.ar/~mdione/glob/posts/sending-aws-cloudwatch-alarms-through-sns-to-msteams/#fn:6\">6</a></sup><sup id=\"fnref:7\"><a class=\"footnote-ref\" href=\"https://www.grulic.org.ar/~mdione/glob/posts/sending-aws-cloudwatch-alarms-through-sns-to-msteams/#fn:7\">7</a></sup>,\\nand another is some kind of\\nmix between a blog and twitter, confusingly called Teams. The idea in a Team is that you can post... Posts? Articles? And\\nfrom them you can have an unthreaded converstion. Only Teams have webhooks; Chats do not, so you can\\'t point SNS there.</p>\\n<p>If you have read other articles about integrating CloudWatch Alerts or SNS to MSTeams, they will always tell you that\\nyou not only need SNS, but also a Lambda program. Since we already handle gazillion servers, not all of them in AWS, and\\none in particular we pay quite cheap for dedicated HW, and also we\\'re trying to slim our AWS bill (who doesn\\'t), I\\ndecided to see if I can build my own bridge between SNS and Teams.</p>\\n<p>I already said that SNS has a litte protocol. The idea is that when you create an HTTP/S Subscription in SNS, it will\\n<code>POST</code> a first message to the URL you define. This message will have a JSON payload.

Notice that the\\nregion is not the codename as in <code>eu-west-1</code> but a supposedly more human readable text. The rest is mostly info about the\\nAlarm itself. Also notice the <code>Dimensions</code> field. I don\\'t know what other data comes here (probably the arbitrary fields\\nand values you can setup in the Alarm), all I can say is that that format (list of dicts with only two fields, one called\\n<code>name</code> and the other <code>value</code>) is possibly the most annoying implementation of a simple dict. I hope they have a reason\\nfor that, besides over engineering.</p>\\n<p>Finally, notice that the only info we get here about the source of the alarm is the <code>InstanceId</code>. As those are random\\nstrings, to me they don\\'t mean anything. Maybe I can setup the Alarm so it also includes the instance\\'a name<sup id=\"fnref:5\"><a class=\"footnote-ref\" href=\"https://www.grulic.org.ar/~mdione/glob/posts/sending-aws-cloudwatch-alarms-through-sns-to-msteams/#fn:5\">5</a></sup>, and\\neven maybe the URL pointing to the metric\\'s graph.</p>\\n<p>Finally, Teams\\' webhook also expects a JSON payload. I didn\\'t delve much in what you can give to it, I just used the\\n<code>title</code>, <code>text</code> and <code>themeColor</code> fields. At least <code>text</code> can be written in MarkDown. You get such a webhook going to the Team,\\nclick in the <code>⋮</code> (\"vertical ellipsis\") icon, \"Connectors\", add a webhook and obtain the URL from there. <code>@type</code> and\\n<code>@context</code> I copied from an SNS-to-Lambda-to-Teams post.</p>\\n<p>So to build a bridge between CloudWatch Alerts through SNS to MSTeams\\'s Team we just need a quite straightforward\\nscript. I decided to write it in Flask, but I\\'m pretty sure writing it in plain <code>http.server</code> and <code>urllib.request</code>\\nto avoid dependencies is not much more work; I just didn\\'t want to do it. Maybe I should have tried FastAPI instead;\\nI simply forgot about it.</p>\\n<p>Without further ado, here\\'s the script. I\\'m running Python 3.8, so I don\\'t have <code>case</code>/<code>match</code> yet.</p>\\n<div class=\"code\"><pre class=\"code literal-block\"><span class=\"ch\">#! /usr/bin/env

Mariusz has made an extraordinary impact as a Django Fellow and has been a critical part of the Django community.</p>\\n<p>The Django Software Foundation and the wider Django community are grateful for his service and assistance.</p>\\n<p>The Fellowship program was started in 2014 as a way to dedicate high-quality and consistent resources to the maintenance of Django. As Django has matured, the DSF has been able to fundraise and earmark funds for this vital role. As a result, the DSF currently supports two Fellows - Mariusz Felisiak and Natalia Bidart. With the departure of Mariusz, the Django Software Foundation is announcing a call for Django Fellow applications. The new Fellow will work alongside Natalia.</p>\\n<p>The position of Fellow is focused on maintenance and community support - the work that benefits most from constant, guaranteed attention rather than volunteer-only efforts. In particular, the duties include:</p>\\n<ul class=\"simple\">\\n<li>Answering contributor questions on Forum and the django-developers mailing list</li>\\n<li>Helping new Django contributors land patches and learn our philosophy</li>\\n<li>Monitoring the <a class=\"reference external\" href=\"mailto:security@djangoproject.com\">security&#64;djangoproject.com</a> email alias and ensuring security issues are acknowledged and responded to promptly</li>\\n<li>Fixing release blockers and helping to ensure timely releases</li>\\n<li>Fixing severe bugs and helping to backport fixes to these and security issues</li>\\n<li>Reviewing and merging pull requests</li>\\n<li>Triaging tickets on Trac</li>\\n</ul>\\n<p>Being a Django contributor isn\\'t a prerequisite for this position — we can help get you up to speed. We\\'ll consider applications from anyone with a proven history of working with either the Django community or another similar open-source community. Geographical location isn\\'t important either - we have several methods of remote communication and coordination that we can use depending on the timezone difference to the supervising members of Django.</p>\\n<p>If you\\'re interested in applying for the position, please email us at <a class=\"reference external\" href=\"mailto:fellowship-committee@djangoproject.com\">fellowship-committee&#64;djangoproject.com</a> describing why you would be a good fit along with details of your relevant experience and community involvement.  Also, please include your preferred hourly rate and when you\\'d like to start working. Lastly, please include at least one recommendation.</p>\\n<p>Applicants will be evaluated based on the following criteria:</p>\\n<ul class=\"simple\">\\n<li>Details of Django and/or other open-source contributions</li>\\n<li>Details of community support in general</li>\\n<li>Understanding of the position</li>\\n<li>Clarity, formality, and precision of communications</li>\\n<li>Strength of recommendation(s)</li>\\n</ul>\\n<p>Applications will be open until 1200 AoE, February 16, 2024, with the expectation that the successful candidate will be notified no later than March 1, 2024.</p>',\n",

       "  'summary': 'We’re very happy to welcome Petr Viktorin as the Deputy Developer in Residence! Better yet, he is joined by Serhiy Storchaka as the Supporting Developer in Residence. This transforms the residency program into a full blown team! We couldn’t be happier.<br /><br />It’s exciting to be able to begin to realize the full vision of the Developers in Residence program, with special thanks to Bloomberg for making it possible for us to bring Petr on board. The initial idea behind the Developer in Residence was to have three to five people hired directly by the Python Software Foundation to help with developer efficiency at CPython, where most of the contributors are volunteers. Three to five people is a good amount to allow for handling both day-to-day tasks, as well as planning and executing on larger-scale projects.<br /><br />We were only able to start with a single Developer in Residence, initially sponsored by Google for the initial year, and by Meta for the following two years. We were <a href=\"https://pyfound.blogspot.com/2023/02/the-case-for-second-developer-in.html\">clear that adding more developers in residence would multiply the impact of the role</a> but, of course, the big question is funding. Fortunately, the success of the initial one-person program allowed for a new sponsor to participate, interested in extending the program with another developer. Thank you, Bloomberg!<br /><br />We <a href=\"https://lukasz.langa.pl/40b601fc-2b24-4629-91d9-3b32c58365c6/\">announced</a> the job opening back in July, and the interview process was extensive. The Foundation received close to 100 applications, and it was a very tough decision, as most were excellent candidates. One surprise in particular was that despite the Deputy role being described as targeting programmers of various experience levels, we received many more applications from Python core developers than during the initial Developer in Residence job opening.<br /><br />Naturally, the core developers bubbled up in the interview process. We were especially impressed by Petr Viktorin’s experience with maintaining Python at Red Hat, his interest in the C API, and his long-term existing contributions to Python. Given the transformative recent developments inside the interpreter in terms of performance and scalability, Petr’s skillset was the perfect match. We’re excited he accepted the offer!<br /><br />However, there was one more person who we were also ready to hire on the spot: Serhiy Storchaka, a rare example of a core developer generalist, with plenty of C experience and contributions across the entire codebase. Consistently one of the top most prolific contributors to Python, we felt like we needed to secure him as a member for the Residents team. Unexpectedly, a generous anonymous donation allowed us to hire Serhiy as well. Thank you!<br /><br />We are calling the role the Supporting Developer in Residence to make it clear the funding level here isn’t as high as in the Deputy case. Please contact us if your organization can help sponsor Serhiy to bump him to the Deputy salary. Serhiy sure deserves it!<br /><br />After an initial meeting with the Steering Council, the Residents team is now ready to take on a more active role in shaping the development of the language. The Council advised that while every team member is expected to prioritize unblocking other contributors and keeping the developer experience smooth, with three people on the team each Resident can now also spend a percentage of their time on feature work aligned with their interests.<br /><br />There are some exciting times ahead for Python!<br /><br />',\n",

We want to provide a transparent process for this, and we also want to ensure that every attendee, whether they are new to the community, or have been at the conference for the 10th time, have the equal opportunity to propose ideas for PyCon US.</p><h2>What belongs in a Hatchery program</h2><p>PyCon US offers a wide range of events for the attendees to engage with the community during the conference. In addition to the talks, Charlas, keynotes, tutorials, posters, and lightning talks, at PyCon US we further support the Python community by hosting summits (e.g. The Python Language Summit, Education Summit), Sprints, and Open Spaces: one-hour meet ups in dedicated rooms throughout the conference. PyCon US also hosts other events like the PyLadies Luncheon, Members Lunch, and PyLadies Auction. We also offer community booths and Startup Row alongside the Sponsor Booths in the expo hall.</p><p>Despite all of the above, as conference organizers we still receive great, creative suggestions and ideas from the community for more things that they’d like to see at PyCon US. This is where the Hatchery program comes in.</p><p>If you have an idea for new and different kinds of events, activities, summits, or tracks at PyCon US, or things that do not fit in any of the existing talks, charlas, tutorials, and posters tracks, please propose that as a Hatchery.</p><p>A few examples of  topics that have been accepted for the program (not a complete list, creativity is expressly encouraged):</p><p></p><ul><li><a href=\"https://us.pycon.org/2023/events/maintainers-summit/\" target=\"_blank\">Maintainers\\' Summit</a></li><li><a href=\"https://us.pycon.org/2020/hatchery/artofpython/\" target=\"_blank\">The Art of Python</a></li><li>Foreign language talk track (see the <a href=\"https://us.pycon.org/2020/speaking/charlas/\" target=\"_blank\">PyCon US Charlas</a>, the first track created in the hatchery, and now a part of PyCon US).</li><li>Scientific data summit</li><li><a href=\"https://us.pycon.org/2023/events/mentored-sprints/\" target=\"_blank\">Mentored Sprints</a></li></ul><p></p><p>See the full guidelines and criteria for proposals at&nbsp;<a href=\"https://us.pycon.org/2024/events/hatchery/\">https://us.pycon.org/2024/events/hatchery/</a></p><h2>Hatchery Program Rebooted!</h2><p>Since it’s been a few years since the last time the Hatchery program ran, meaning, some folks might have already forgotten about it, and newer community members might not yet know what it’s about. With that in mind we decided that this is a good time for us to introduce some changes to the Hatchery program.</p><h3>One-off events are encouraged!</h3><p>Previous versions of the Hatchery prioritized programs that have potential to become a new staple and repeat program at PyCon US, and one-off events were given a lower priority. We recognize that this might put a high barrier of entry, and could potentially cause organizer burnout. People might feel like they are now “obligated” to continue the program year after year even if they no longer have the bandwidth to do it. Therefore, we want to focus on the experimental aspect of Hatchery. If your Hatchery program is accepted this year, you are free to continue it again next year. But if you just want to experiment and host an activity only for this year, that’s okay too!</p><h3>Rolling admission</h3><p>You can propose your idea for the Hatchery starting today, until approximately 4 weeks before the conference.&nbsp;</p><p>We will be reviewing your ideas and proposals as they come in, and we will do our best to support and accommodate your request. We aim to give you a decision within 2 weeks, depending on the nature of your proposal. (i.e. if your proposal requires a more complicated room set up, we may need extra time to figure out the feasibility for that).</p><p>Proposal submissions for the <a href=\"https://us.pycon.org/2024/events/hatchery/\">Hatchery Program</a> are open until <b>April 17, 2024, or until all the spaces have been filled.</b></p><p>Note that the conference venue is limited in terms of size and available rooms. We might not be able to provide you with a room you need for your program if you wait until the last minute to submit your idea. Therefore, we encourage you to submit your ideas as soon as you can!</p><h2>How to submit your Hatchery proposal?</h2><p>Please visit the <a href=\"https://us.pycon.org/2024/events/hatchery/\">PyCon US 2024 Hatchery page</a>.

       "  'summary': '<div><p><strong>Data analysis</strong> is a broad term that covers a wide range of techniques that enable you to reveal any insights and relationships that may exist within raw data. As you might expect, Python lends itself readily to data analysis. Once Python has analyzed your data, you can then use your findings to make good business decisions, improve procedures, and even make informed predictions based on what you’ve discovered.</p>\\n<p><strong>In this tutorial, you’ll:</strong></p>\\n<ul>\\n<li>Understand the need for a sound <strong>data analysis workflow</strong></li>\\n<li>Understand the <strong>different stages</strong> of a data analysis workflow</li>\\n<li>Learn how you can use <strong>Python</strong> for data analysis</li>\\n</ul>\\n<p>Before you start, you should familiarize yourself with <a href=\"https://realpython.com/jupyter-notebook-introduction/\">Jupyter Notebook</a>, a popular tool for data analysis. Alternatively, <a href=\"https://realpython.com/using-jupyterlab/\">JupyterLab</a> will give you an enhanced notebook experience. You might also like to learn how a <a href=\"https://realpython.com/pandas-dataframe/#introducing-the-pandas-dataframe\">pandas DataFrame</a> stores its data. Knowing the difference between a <a href=\"https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/user_guide/dsintro.html#dataframe\">DataFrame</a> and a <a href=\"https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/user_guide/dsintro.html#series\">pandas Series</a> will also prove useful.</p>\\n<div class=\"alert alert-warning\">\\n<p><strong>Get Your Code:</strong> <a class=\"alert-link\" href=\"https://realpython.com/bonus/python-for-data-analysis-code/\">Click here to download the free data files and sample code</a> for your mission into data analysis with Python.</p>\\n</div>\\n<p>In this tutorial, you’ll use a file named <code>james_bond_data.csv</code>. This is a doctored version of the free <a href=\"https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/dreb87/jamesbond/data\">James Bond Movie Dataset</a>. The <code>james_bond_data.csv</code> file contains a subset of the original data with some of the records altered to make them suitable for this tutorial. You’ll find it in the downloadable materials. Once you have your data file, you’re ready to begin your first mission into data analysis.</p>\\n<h2 id=\"understanding-the-need-for-a-data-analysis-workflow\">Understanding the Need for a Data Analysis Workflow<a class=\"headerlink\" href=\"https://realpython.com/atom.xml#understanding-the-need-for-a-data-analysis-workflow\" title=\"Permanent link\"></a></h2>\\n<p>Data analysis is a very popular field and can involve performing many different tasks of varying complexity. Which specific analysis steps you perform will depend on which dataset you’re analyzing and what information you hope to glean. To overcome these scope and complexity issues, you need to take a strategic approach when performing your analysis. This is where a <strong>data analysis workflow</strong> can help you.</p>\\n<p>A data analysis workflow is a process that provides a set of steps for your analysis team to follow when analyzing data. The implementation of each of these steps will vary depending on the nature of your analysis, but following an agreed-upon workflow allows everyone involved to know what needs to happen and to see how the project is progressing.</p>\\n<p>Using a workflow also helps futureproof your analysis methodology. By following the defined set of steps, your efforts become systematic, which minimizes the possibility that you’ll make mistakes or miss something. Furthermore, when you carefully document your work, you can reapply your procedures against future data as it becomes available. Data analysis workflows therefore also provide repeatability and scalability.</p>\\n<p>There’s no single data workflow process that suits every analysis, nor is there universal terminology for the procedures used within it. To provide a structure for the rest of this tutorial, the diagram below illustrates the stages that you’ll commonly find in most workflows:</p>\\n<a href=\"https://files.realpython.com/media/ie-data-analysis-workflowv3.bfb835b95c5e.png\" target=\"_blank\"><img alt=\"diagram of a data analysis workflow with iterations\" class=\"img-fluid mx-auto d-block \" height=\"569\" src=\"https://files.realpython.com/media/ie-data-analysis-workflowv3.bfb835b95c5e.png\" width=\"1292\" /></a>A Data Analysis Workflow\\n\\n<p>The solid arrows show the standard data analysis workflow that you’ll work through to learn what happens at each stage. The dashed arrows indicate where you may need to carry out some of the individual steps several times depending upon the success of your analysis. Indeed, you may even have to repeat the entire process should your first analysis reveal something interesting that demands further attention.</p>\\n<p>Now that you have an understanding of the need for a data analysis workflow, you’ll work through its steps and perform an analysis of movie data. The movies that you’ll analyze all relate to the British secret agent Bond … <em>James Bond.</em></p>\\n<h2 id=\"setting-your-objectives\">Setting Your Objectives<a class=\"headerlink\" href=\"https://realpython.com/atom.xml#setting-your-objectives\" title=\"Permanent link\"></a></h2>\\n<p>The very first workflow step in data analysis is to carefully but clearly define your objectives. It’s vitally important for you and your analysis team to be clear on what exactly you’re all trying to achieve. This step doesn’t involve any programming but is every bit as important because, without an understanding of where you want to go, you’re unlikely to ever get there.</p>\\n<p>The objectives of your data analysis will vary depending on what you’re analyzing. Your team leader may want to know why a new product hasn’t sold, or perhaps your government wants information about a clinical test of a new medical drug. You may even be asked to make investment recommendations based on the past results of a particular financial instrument. Regardless, you must still be clear on your objectives. These define your scope.</p>\\n<p>In this tutorial, you’ll gain experience in data analysis by having some fun with the James Bond movie dataset mentioned earlier. What are your objectives? <em>Now pay attention, 007</em>:</p>\\n<ul>\\n<li>Is there any relationship between the Rotten Tomatoes ratings and those from IMDb?</li>\\n<li>Are there any insights to be gleaned from analyzing the lengths of the movies?</li>\\n<li>Is there a relationship between the number of enemies James Bond has killed and the user ratings of the movie in which they were killed?</li>\\n</ul>\\n<p>Now that you’ve been briefed on your mission, it’s time to get out into the field and see what intelligence you can uncover.</p>\\n<h2 id=\"acquiring-your-data\">Acquiring Your Data<a class=\"headerlink\" href=\"https://realpython.com/atom.xml#acquiring-your-data\" title=\"Permanent link\"></a></h2>\\n<p>Once you’ve established your objectives, your next step is to think about what data you’ll need to achieve them. Hopefully, this data will be readily available, but you may have to work hard to get it. You may need to extract it from the data storage systems within an organization or <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Survey_data_collection\">collect survey data</a>. Regardless, you’ll somehow need to get the data.</p>\\n<p>In this case, you’re in luck. When your bosses briefed you on your objectives, they also gave you the data in the <code>james_bond_data.csv</code> file. You must now spend some time becoming familiar with what you have in front of you. During the briefing, you made some notes on the content of this file:</p>\\n<div class=\"table-responsive\">\\n<table class=\"table table-hover\">\\n<thead>\\n<tr>\\n<th>Heading</th>\\n<th>Meaning</th>\\n</tr>\\n</thead>\\n<tbody>\\n<tr>\\n<td><code>Release</code></td>\\n<td>The release date of the movie</td>\\n</tr>\\n<tr>\\n<td><code>Movie</code></td>\\n<td>The title of the movie</td>\\n</tr>\\n<tr>\\n<td><code>Bond</code></td>\\n<td>The actor playing the title role</td>\\n</tr>\\n<tr>\\n<td><code>Bond_Car_MFG</code></td>\\n<td>The manufacturer of James Bond’s car</td>\\n</tr>\\n<tr>\\n<td><code>US_Gross</code></td>\\n<td>The movie’s gross US earnings</td>\\n</tr>\\n<tr>\\n<td><code>World_Gross</code></td>\\n<td>The movie’s gross worldwide earnings</td>\\n</tr>\\n<tr>\\n<td><code>Budget ($ 000s)</code></td>\\n<td>The movie’s budget, in thousands of US dollars</td>\\n</tr>\\n<tr>\\n<td><code>Film_Length</code></td>\\n<td>The running time of the movie</td>\\n</tr>\\n<tr>\\n<td><code>Avg_User_IMDB</code></td>\\n<td>The average user rating from IMDb</td>\\n</tr>\\n<tr>\\n<td><code>Avg_User_Rtn_Tom</code></td>\\n<td>The average user rating from Rotten Tomatoes</td>\\n</tr>\\n<tr>\\n<td><code>Martinis</code></td>\\n<td>The number of martinis that Bond drank in the movie</td>\\n</tr>\\n</tbody>\\n</table>\\n</div>\\n<p>As you can see, you have quite a variety of data. You won’t need all of it to meet your objectives, but you can think more about this later. For now, you’ll concentrate on getting the data out of the file and into Python for cleansing and analysis.</p>\\n</div><h2><a href=\"https://realpython.com/python-for-data-analysis/?utm_source=realpython&amp;utm_medium=rss\">Read the full article at https://realpython.com/python-for-data-analysis/ »</a></h2>\\n        <hr />\\n        <p><em>[ Improve Your Python With 🐍 Python Tricks 💌 – Get a short &amp; sweet Python Trick delivered to your inbox every couple of days. <a href=\"https://realpython.com/python-tricks/?utm_source=realpython&amp;utm_medium=rss&amp;utm_campaign=footer\">&gt;&gt; Click here to learn more and see examples</a> ]</em></p>',\n",

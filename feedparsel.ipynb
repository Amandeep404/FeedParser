Others have\\narticulated <a href=\"https://mastodon.social/deck/@danilo@hachyderm.io/111811994313558262\">compelling emotional\\nnarratives</a>\\nthat easily eclipse my own similar childhood memories of the Macintosh family\\nof computers.  So instead, I will ask a question:</p>\\n<p>What <em>is</em> the Macintosh?</p>\\n<p>As this is the anniversary of the beginning, that is where I will begin.  The\\noriginal Macintosh, the classic MacOS, the original “System Software” are a\\nshining example of “fake it till you make it”. The original mac operating\\nsystem was fake.</p>\\n<p>Don’t get me wrong, it was an <em>impressive</em> technical achievement to fake\\nsomething like this, but what Steve Jobs did was to see a demo of a\\n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smalltalk\">Smalltalk</a>-76 system, an\\nobject-oriented programming environment with 1-to-1 correspondences between\\ngraphical objects on screen and runtime-introspectable data structures, a\\nself-hosting high level programming language, memory safety, message passing,\\ngarbage collection, and many other advanced facilities that would not be\\npopularized for decades, and make a fake version of it which ran on hardware\\nthat consumers could actually afford, by throwing out most of what made the\\nprogramming environment interesting and replacing it with a much more\\nmemory-efficient illusion implemented in 68000 assembler and Pascal.</p>\\n<p>The machine’s RAM didn’t have room for a kernel.  Whatever application was\\nrunning was in control of the whole system.  No protected memory, no preemptive\\nmultitasking.  It was a house of cards that was destined to collapse.  And\\ncollapse it did, both in the short term and the long.  In the short term, the\\nsystem was buggy and unstable, and application crashes resulted in system halts\\nand reboots.</p>\\n<p>In the longer term, the company based on the Macintosh effectively went out of\\nbusiness and was reverse-acquired by NeXT, but they kept the better-known\\nbranding of the older company.  The old operating system was gradually disposed\\nof, quickly replaced at its core with a significantly more mature generation of\\noperating system technology based on BSD UNIX and Mach.  With the removal of\\nCarbon compatibility 4 years ago, the last vestigial traces of it were removed.\\nBut even as early as 2004 the Mac was no longer <em>really</em> the Macintosh.</p>\\n<p>What NeXT had built was much closer to the Smalltalk system that Jobs was\\noriginally attempting to emulate.  Its programming language, “Objective C”\\nexplicitly called back to Smalltalk’s message-passing, right down to the\\nsyntax.  Objects on the screen now <em>did</em> correspond to “objects” you could send\\nmessages to.  The development environment understood this too; that was a major\\nselling point.</p>\\n<p>The NeXSTEP operating system and Objective C runtime did not have garbage\\ncollection, but it provided a similar developer experience by providing\\nreference-counting throughout its object model.  The original vision was\\nfinally achieved, for real, and that’s what we have on our desks and in our\\nbackpacks today (and in our pockets, in the form of the iPhone, which is in\\nsome sense a tiny next-generation NeXT computer itself).</p>\\n<hr />\\n<p>The one detail I will relate from my own childhood is this: my first computer\\nwas not a Mac.  My <em>first</em> computer, as a child, was an\\n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amiga\">Amiga</a>.  When I was 5, I had a computer\\nwith 4096 colors, real multitasking, 3D graphics, and a paint program that\\ncould draw hard real-time animations with palette tricks.  Then the writing was\\non the wall for Commodore and I got a computer which had 256 colors, a bunch of\\nold software that was still black and white, an operating system that would\\nfreeze if you held down the mouse button on the menu bar and couldn’t even play\\nanimations smoothly.  Many will relay their first encounter with the Mac as a\\nkind of magic, but mine was a feeling of loss and disappointment.  Unlike\\nalmost everyone at the time, I knew what a computer <em>really</em> could be, and\\ndespite many pleasant and formative experiences with the Macintosh in the\\nmeanwhile, it would be a decade before I saw a real one again.</p>\\n<p>But this is not to deride the faking. The faking was <em>necessary</em>. Xerox was not\\ngoing to put an Alto running Smalltalk on anyone’s desk. People have always\\ngrumbled that Apple products are expensive, but in 2024 dollars, one of these\\nXerox computers cost roughly $55,000.</p>\\n<p>The Amiga was, in its own way, a similar sort of fake.  It managed its own\\nmiracles by putting performance-critical functions into dedicated hardware\\nwhich rapidly became obsolete as software technology evolved much more rapidly.</p>\\n<p>Jobs is celebrated as a genius of product design, and he certainly wasn’t bad\\nat it, but I had the rare privilege of seeing the homework he was cribbing from\\nin that subject, and in my estimation he was a B student at best.  Where he got\\nan A was bringing a vision to life by <em>creating an organization</em>, both inside\\nand outside of his companies.</p>\\n<p>If you want a culture-defining technological artifact, <em>everybody in the\\nculture</em> has to be able to get their hands on one.  This doesn’t just mean that\\nthe builder has to be able to build it.  The buyer also has to be able to\\nafford it, obviously.  Developers have to be able to develop for it.  The buyer\\nhas to <em>actually want</em> it; the much-derided “marketing” is a necessary part of\\nthe process of making a product what it is.  Everyone needs to be able to move\\ntogether in the direction of the same technological future.</p>\\n<p>This is why it was so fitting that Tim Cook was made Jobs\\'s successor.  The\\nsupply chain <em>was</em> the hard part.</p>\\n<p>The crowning, final achievement of Jobs’s career was the fact that not only did\\nhe fake it — the fakes were flying fast and thick at that time in history, even\\nif they mostly weren’t as good — it was that he faked it and then he built the\\nreal version and then he <em>bridged the transitions</em> to get to the real thing.</p>\\n<p>I began here by saying that the Mac isn’t really the Mac, and speaking in terms\\nof a point in time analysis that is true.  Its technology today has practically\\nnothing in common with its technology in 1984.  This is not merely an artifact\\nof the length of time here: the technology at the core of various UNIXes in\\n1984 bears a lot of resemblance of UNIX-like operating systems today<sup id=\"fnref:1:the-macintosh-2024-1\"><a class=\"footnote-ref\" href=\"https://glyph.twistedmatrix.com/feeds/all.atom.xml#fn:1:the-macintosh-2024-1\" id=\"fnref:1\">1</a></sup>.

It moved from black and white to color,\\nfrom desktop to laptop, from Carbon to Cocoa, from Display PostScript to\\nDisplay PDF, all the while preserving instantly recognizable iconic features\\nlike the apple menu and the cursor pointer, while providing developers\\ndocumentation and SDKs and training sessions that helped them transition their\\napps through multiple near-complete rewrites as a result of all of these\\nchanges.</p>\\n<hr />\\n<p>To paraphrase Abigail Thorne’s <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYVFep0xFYs\">first video about\\nIdentity</a>, <em>identity </em><strong>is</strong><em> what\\nsurvives</em>.

GitHub puts a little green “verified” badge next to commits that are\\nsigned, which is neat, I guess.  They provide “security”.  1Password provides a\\n<a href=\"https://developer.1password.com/docs/ssh/git-commit-signing/\">nice UI</a> for\\nsetting it up.

Their purse is the word “Verified”; it’s still green.\\nIf you enable “<a href=\"https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/managing-commit-signature-verification/displaying-verification-statuses-for-all-of-your-commits\">vigilant\\nmode</a>”,\\nyou can make the blank “no verification status” option say “Unverified”, but\\nnot much else changes.</p>\\n<p>This is like the old-style HTTPS verification “Yes”/“No” dialog, except that\\nthere is not even an interruption to your workflow.  They might put the\\n“Unverified” status on there, but they’ve gone ahead and clicked “Yes” for you.</p>\\n<p>It is tempting to think that the “HTTPS” metaphor will map neatly onto Git\\ncommit signatures.  It was bad when the web wasn’t using HTTPS, and the next\\nstep in that process was for <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Let%27s_Encrypt\">Let’s\\nEncrypt</a> to come along and for\\nthe browsers to fix their implementations.  Getting your certificates properly\\nset up in the meanwhile and becoming familiar with the tools for properly doing\\nHTTPS was unambiguously a <em>good</em> thing for an engineer to do.  I did, and I’m\\nquite glad I did so!</p>\\n<p>However, there is a significant difference: signing and encrypting an HTTPS\\nrequest is ephemeral; signing a Git commit is functionally permanent.</p>\\n<p>This ephemeral nature meant that errors in the early HTTPS landscape were\\neasily fixable.  Earlier I mentioned that there was a time where you might\\n<em>not</em> want to set up HTTPS on your production web servers, because any small\\nscrew-up would break your site and thereby your business.  But if you were\\nreally skilled and you could see the future coming, you could set up\\nmonitoring, avoid these mistakes, and rapidly recover.  These mistakes didn’t\\nneed to badly break your site.</p>\\n<p>We <em>can</em> extend the analogy to HTTPS, but we have to take a detour into one of\\nthe more unpleasant mistakes in HTTPS’s history: <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTP_Public_Key_Pinning\">HTTP Public Key\\nPinning</a>, or “HPKP”.\\nThe idea with HPKP was that you could publish a record in an HTTP header where\\nyour site commits<sup id=\"fnref:2:unsigned-commits-2024-1\"><a class=\"footnote-ref\" href=\"https://glyph.twistedmatrix.com/feeds/all.atom.xml#fn:2:unsigned-commits-2024-1\" id=\"fnref:2\">2</a></sup> to using certain certificate authorities for a period of\\ntime, where that period of time could be “forever”.  Attackers gonna attack,\\nand <a href=\"https://scotthelme.co.uk/using-security-features-to-do-bad-things/#usinghpkpforevil\">attack they\\ndid</a>.\\nEven without getting attacked, a site could easily commit “HPKP Suicide” where\\nthey would pin the wrong certificate authority with a long timeline, and their\\nsite was effectively gone for every browser that had ever seen those pins.  As\\na result, after a few years, HPKP was <a href=\"https://scotthelme.co.uk/hpkp-is-no-more/\">completely removed from all\\nbrowsers</a>.</p>\\n<p>Git commit signing is even worse.  With HPKP, you could easily make terrible\\nmistakes with permanent consequences even though you knew the <em>exact</em> meaning\\nof the data you were putting into the system at the time you were doing it.\\nWith signed commits, you are saying something permanently, but you don’t really\\nknow <em>what</em> it is that you’re saying.</p>\\n<hr />\\n<p><em>Today</em>, what is the benefit of signing a Git commit?  GitHub might present it\\nas “Verified”.  It’s worth noting that only <em>GitHub</em> will do this, since they\\nare the root of trust for this signing scheme.  So, by signing commits and\\nregistering your keys with GitHub, you are, at best, helping to lock in GitHub\\nas a permanent piece of infrastructure that is even harder to dislodge because\\nthey are not only where your code is stored, but also the arbiters of whether\\nor not it is trustworthy.</p>\\n<p><em>In the future</em>, what is the possible security benefit?  If we all collectively\\ndecide we want Git to be more secure, then we will need to meaningfully treat\\nsigned commits differently from unsigned ones.</p>\\n<p>There’s a long tail of unsigned commits several billion entries long.  And\\nthose are in the permanent record as much as the signed ones are, so future\\ntooling will have to be able to deal with them.  If, as stewards of Git, we\\nwish to move towards a more secure Git, as the stewards of the web moved\\ntowards a more secure web, we do <em>not</em> have the option that the web did.  In\\nthe browser, the meaning of a plain-text HTTP or incorrectly-signed HTTPS site\\nchanged, in order to encourage the site’s operator to <em>change</em> the site to be\\nHTTPS.</p>\\n<p>In contrast, the meaning of an unsigned commit cannot change, because there are\\nzillions of unsigned commits lying around in critical infrastructure and we\\nneed them to remain there.  Commits cannot meaningfully be changed to become\\nsigned retroactively.  Unlike an online website, they are part of a historical\\nrecord, not an operating program.  So we cannot establish the difference in\\ntreatment by changing how unsigned commits are treated.</p>\\n<p>That means that tooling maintainers will need to provide some difference in\\nbehavior that provides some incentive.  With HTTPS where the binary choice was\\nclear: don’t present sites with incorrect, potentially compromised\\nconfigurations to users.  The question was just <em>how</em> to achieve that.  With\\nGit commits, the difference in treatment of a “trusted” commit is far less\\nclear.</p>\\n<p>If you will forgive me a slight straw-man here, one possible naive\\ninterpretation is that a “trusted” signed commit is that it’s OK to run in CI.\\nConveniently, it’s not simply “trusted” in a general sense.  If you signed it,\\nit’s trusted to be <em>from you</em>, specifically.  Surely it’s fine if we bill the\\nCI costs for validating the PR that includes that signed commit to your GitHub\\naccount?</p>\\n<p>Now, someone can piggy-back off a 1-line typo fix that you made on top of an\\nunsigned commit to some large repo, making you implicitly responsible for\\ntransitively signing all unsigned parent commits, even though you haven’t\\nlooked at any of the code.</p>\\n<p>Remember, also, that the only central authority that is practically trustable\\nat this point is your GitHub account.  That means that if you are using a\\nthird-party CI system, even if you’re using a third-party Git host, you can\\nonly run “trusted” code if GitHub is online and responding to requests for its\\n“get me the trusted signing keys for this user” API.  This also adds a lot of\\nvalue to a GitHub credential breach, strongly motivating attackers to sneakily\\nattach their own keys to your account so that their commits in unrelated repos\\ncan be “Verified” by you.</p>\\n<p>Let’s review the pros and cons of turning on commit signing <em>now</em>, before you\\nknow what it is going to be used for:</p>\\n<table>\\n<thead>\\n<tr>\\n<th align=\"left\">Pro</th>\\n<th align=\"left\">Con</th>\\n</tr>\\n</thead>\\n<tbody>\\n<tr>\\n<td align=\"left\">Green “Verified” badge</td>\\n<td align=\"left\"><strong>Unknown, possibly unlimited future liability</strong> for the consequences of running code in a commit you signed</td>\\n</tr>\\n<tr>\\n<td align=\"left\"><div></div></td>\\n<td align=\"left\">Further implicitly cementing GitHub as a  centralized trust authority in the open source world</td>\\n</tr>\\n<tr>\\n<td align=\"left\"></td>\\n<td align=\"left\">Introducing unknown reliability problems into infrastructure that relies on commit signatures</td>\\n</tr>\\n<tr>\\n<td align=\"left\"></td>\\n<td align=\"left\">Temporary breach of your GitHub credentials now lead to potentially permanent consequences if someone can smuggle a new trusted key in there</td>\\n</tr>\\n<tr>\\n<td align=\"left\"></td>\\n<td align=\"left\">New kinds of ongoing process overhead as commit-signing keys become new permanent load-bearing infrastructure, like “what do I do with expired keys”, “how often should I rotate these”, and so on</td>\\n</tr>\\n</tbody>\\n</table>\\n<p>I feel like the “Con” column is coming out ahead.</p>\\n<hr />\\n<p>That probably seemed like increasingly unhinged hyperbole, and it was.</p>\\n<p>In reality, the consequences are unlikely to be nearly so dramatic.  The status\\nquo has a very high amount of inertia, and probably the “Verified” badge will\\nremain the only visible difference, except for a few repo-specific esoteric\\nworkflows, like pushing trust verification into offline or sandboxed build\\nsystems.  I do still think that there is <em>some</em> potential for nefariousness\\naround the “unknown and unlimited” dimension of any future plans that might\\nrely on verifying signed commits, but any flaws are likely to be subtle attack\\nchains and not anything flashy and obvious.</p>\\n<p>But I think that one of the biggest problems in information security is a lack\\nof <a href=\"https://owasp.org/www-community/Threat_Modeling\">threat modeling</a>.  We\\nencrypt things, we sign things, we institute <a href=\"https://cryptosmith.com/password-sanity/exp-harmful/\">rotation\\npolicies</a> and\\n<a href=\"https://neal.fun/password-game/\">elaborate</a> useless\\n<a href=\"https://xkcd.com/936/\">rules</a> for passwords, because we are looking for a\\n“best practice” that is going to save us from having to think about what our\\nactual security problems are.</p>\\n<p>I think the actual harm of signing git commits is to perpetuate an engineering\\nculture of unquestioningly cargo-culting sophisticated and complex tools like\\ncryptographic signatures into new contexts where they have no use.</p>\\n<p>Just from a baseline utilitarian philosophical perspective, for a given action\\nA, all else being equal, it’s always better <em>not</em> to do A, because taking an\\naction always has <em>some</em> non-zero opportunity cost even if it is just the time\\ntaken to do it.  Epsilon cost and zero benefit is still a net harm.  This is\\neven more true in the context of a complex system.  Any action taken in\\nresponse to a rule in a system is going to interact with all the other rules in\\nthat system.  You have to pay complexity-rent on every new rule.  So an\\napparently-useless embellishment like signing commits can have potentially\\nfar-reaching consequences in the future.</p>\\n<p>Git commit signing itself is not particularly consequential.  I have probably\\nspent more time writing this blog post than the sum total of all the time\\nwasted by all programmers configuring their git clients to add useless\\nsignatures; even the relatively modest readership of this blog will likely\\ntransfer more data reading this post than all those signatures will take to\\ntransmit to the various git clients that will read them.  If I just convince\\nyou not to sign your commits, I don’t think I’m coming out ahead in the\\n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Felicific_calculus\">felicific calculus</a> here.</p>\\n<p>What I am actually trying to point out here is that it is useful to <em>carefully\\nconsider how to avoid adding junk complexity to your systems</em>.  One area where\\njunk tends to leak in to designs and to cultures particularly easily is in\\nintimidating subjects like trust and safety, where it is easy to get anxious\\nand convince ourselves that piling on more <em>stuff</em> is safer than leaving things\\nsimple.</p>\\n<p>If I can help you avoid adding even a little bit of unnecessary complexity, I\\nthink it will have been well worth the cost of the writing, and the reading.</p>\\n<h2 id=\"acknowledgments\">Acknowledgments</h2>\\n<p class=\"update-note\">Thank you to <a href=\"https://www.patreon.com/creatorglyph\">my patrons</a> who are\\nsupporting my writing on this blog.

It was bad when the web wasn’t using HTTPS, and the next\\nstep in that process was for <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Let%27s_Encrypt\">Let’s\\nEncrypt</a> to come along and for\\nthe browsers to fix their implementations.  Getting your certificates properly\\nset up in the meanwhile and becoming familiar with the tools for properly doing\\nHTTPS was unambiguously a <em>good</em> thing for an engineer to do.  I did, and I’m\\nquite glad I did so!</p>\\n<p>However, there is a significant difference: signing and encrypting an HTTPS\\nrequest is ephemeral; signing a Git commit is functionally permanent.</p>\\n<p>This ephemeral nature meant that errors in the early HTTPS landscape were\\neasily fixable.  Earlier I mentioned that there was a time where you might\\n<em>not</em> want to set up HTTPS on your production web servers, because any small\\nscrew-up would break your site and thereby your business.  But if you were\\nreally skilled and you could see the future coming, you could set up\\nmonitoring, avoid these mistakes, and rapidly recover.  These mistakes didn’t\\nneed to badly break your site.</p>\\n<p>We <em>can</em> extend the analogy to HTTPS, but we have to take a detour into one of\\nthe more unpleasant mistakes in HTTPS’s history: <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTP_Public_Key_Pinning\">HTTP Public Key\\nPinning</a>, or “HPKP”.\\nThe idea with HPKP was that you could publish a record in an HTTP header where\\nyour site commits<sup id=\"fnref:2:unsigned-commits-2024-1\"><a class=\"footnote-ref\" href=\"https://glyph.twistedmatrix.com/feeds/all.atom.xml#fn:2:unsigned-commits-2024-1\" id=\"fnref:2\">2</a></sup> to using certain certificate authorities for a period of\\ntime, where that period of time could be “forever”.  Attackers gonna attack,\\nand <a href=\"https://scotthelme.co.uk/using-security-features-to-do-bad-things/#usinghpkpforevil\">attack they\\ndid</a>.\\nEven without getting attacked, a site could easily commit “HPKP Suicide” where\\nthey would pin the wrong certificate authority with a long timeline, and their\\nsite was effectively gone for every browser that had ever seen those pins.  As\\na result, after a few years, HPKP was <a href=\"https://scotthelme.co.uk/hpkp-is-no-more/\">completely removed from all\\nbrowsers</a>.</p>\\n<p>Git commit signing is even worse.  With HPKP, you could easily make terrible\\nmistakes with permanent consequences even though you knew the <em>exact</em> meaning\\nof the data you were putting into the system at the time you were doing it.\\nWith signed commits, you are saying something permanently, but you don’t really\\nknow <em>what</em> it is that you’re saying.</p>\\n<hr />\\n<p><em>Today</em>, what is the benefit of signing a Git commit?  GitHub might present it\\nas “Verified”.  It’s worth noting that only <em>GitHub</em> will do this, since they\\nare the root of trust for this signing scheme.  So, by signing commits and\\nregistering your keys with GitHub, you are, at best, helping to lock in GitHub\\nas a permanent piece of infrastructure that is even harder to dislodge because\\nthey are not only where your code is stored, but also the arbiters of whether\\nor not it is trustworthy.</p>\\n<p><em>In the future</em>, what is the possible security benefit?  If we all collectively\\ndecide we want Git to be more secure, then we will need to meaningfully treat\\nsigned commits differently from unsigned ones.</p>\\n<p>There’s a long tail of unsigned commits several billion entries long.  And\\nthose are in the permanent record as much as the signed ones are, so future\\ntooling will have to be able to deal with them.  If, as stewards of Git, we\\nwish to move towards a more secure Git, as the stewards of the web moved\\ntowards a more secure web, we do <em>not</em> have the option that the web did.  In\\nthe browser, the meaning of a plain-text HTTP or incorrectly-signed HTTPS site\\nchanged, in order to encourage the site’s operator to <em>change</em> the site to be\\nHTTPS.</p>\\n<p>In contrast, the meaning of an unsigned commit cannot change, because there are\\nzillions of unsigned commits lying around in critical infrastructure and we\\nneed them to remain there.  Commits cannot meaningfully be changed to become\\nsigned retroactively.  Unlike an online website, they are part of a historical\\nrecord, not an operating program.  So we cannot establish the difference in\\ntreatment by changing how unsigned commits are treated.</p>\\n<p>That means that tooling maintainers will need to provide some difference in\\nbehavior that provides some incentive.  With HTTPS where the binary choice was\\nclear: don’t present sites with incorrect, potentially compromised\\nconfigurations to users.  The question was just <em>how</em> to achieve that.  With\\nGit commits, the difference in treatment of a “trusted” commit is far less\\nclear.</p>\\n<p>If you will forgive me a slight straw-man here, one possible naive\\ninterpretation is that a “trusted” signed commit is that it’s OK to run in CI.\\nConveniently, it’s not simply “trusted” in a general sense.  If you signed it,\\nit’s trusted to be <em>from you</em>, specifically.  Surely it’s fine if we bill the\\nCI costs for validating the PR that includes that signed commit to your GitHub\\naccount?</p>\\n<p>Now, someone can piggy-back off a 1-line typo fix that you made on top of an\\nunsigned commit to some large repo, making you implicitly responsible for\\ntransitively signing all unsigned parent commits, even though you haven’t\\nlooked at any of the code.</p>\\n<p>Remember, also, that the only central authority that is practically trustable\\nat this point is your GitHub account.  That means that if you are using a\\nthird-party CI system, even if you’re using a third-party Git host, you can\\nonly run “trusted” code if GitHub is online and responding to requests for its\\n“get me the trusted signing keys for this user” API.  This also adds a lot of\\nvalue to a GitHub credential breach, strongly motivating attackers to sneakily\\nattach their own keys to your account so that their commits in unrelated repos\\ncan be “Verified” by you.</p>\\n<p>Let’s review the pros and cons of turning on commit signing <em>now</em>, before you\\nknow what it is going to be used for:</p>\\n<table>\\n<thead>\\n<tr>\\n<th align=\"left\">Pro</th>\\n<th align=\"left\">Con</th>\\n</tr>\\n</thead>\\n<tbody>\\n<tr>\\n<td align=\"left\">Green “Verified” badge</td>\\n<td align=\"left\"><strong>Unknown, possibly unlimited future liability</strong> for the consequences of running code in a commit you signed</td>\\n</tr>\\n<tr>\\n<td align=\"left\"><div></div></td>\\n<td align=\"left\">Further implicitly cementing GitHub as a  centralized trust authority in the open source world</td>\\n</tr>\\n<tr>\\n<td align=\"left\"></td>\\n<td align=\"left\">Introducing unknown reliability problems into infrastructure that relies on commit signatures</td>\\n</tr>\\n<tr>\\n<td align=\"left\"></td>\\n<td align=\"left\">Temporary breach of your GitHub credentials now lead to potentially permanent consequences if someone can smuggle a new trusted key in there</td>\\n</tr>\\n<tr>\\n<td align=\"left\"></td>\\n<td align=\"left\">New kinds of ongoing process overhead as commit-signing keys become new permanent load-bearing infrastructure, like “what do I do with expired keys”, “how often should I rotate these”, and so on</td>\\n</tr>\\n</tbody>\\n</table>\\n<p>I feel like the “Con” column is coming out ahead.</p>\\n<hr />\\n<p>That probably seemed like increasingly unhinged hyperbole, and it was.</p>\\n<p>In reality, the consequences are unlikely to be nearly so dramatic.  The status\\nquo has a very high amount of inertia, and probably the “Verified” badge will\\nremain the only visible difference, except for a few repo-specific esoteric\\nworkflows, like pushing trust verification into offline or sandboxed build\\nsystems.  I do still think that there is <em>some</em> potential for nefariousness\\naround the “unknown and unlimited” dimension of any future plans that might\\nrely on verifying signed commits, but any flaws are likely to be subtle attack\\nchains and not anything flashy and obvious.</p>\\n<p>But I think that one of the biggest problems in information security is a lack\\nof <a href=\"https://owasp.org/www-community/Threat_Modeling\">threat modeling</a>.  We\\nencrypt things, we sign things, we institute <a href=\"https://cryptosmith.com/password-sanity/exp-harmful/\">rotation\\npolicies</a> and\\n<a href=\"https://neal.fun/password-game/\">elaborate</a> useless\\n<a href=\"https://xkcd.com/936/\">rules</a> for passwords, because we are looking for a\\n“best practice” that is going to save us from having to think about what our\\nactual security problems are.</p>\\n<p>I think the actual harm of signing git commits is to perpetuate an engineering\\nculture of unquestioningly cargo-culting sophisticated and complex tools like\\ncryptographic signatures into new contexts where they have no use.</p>\\n<p>Just from a baseline utilitarian philosophical perspective, for a given action\\nA, all else being equal, it’s always better <em>not</em> to do A, because taking an\\naction always has <em>some</em> non-zero opportunity cost even if it is just the time\\ntaken to do it.  Epsilon cost and zero benefit is still a net harm.  This is\\neven more true in the context of a complex system.  Any action taken in\\nresponse to a rule in a system is going to interact with all the other rules in\\nthat system.  You have to pay complexity-rent on every new rule.  So an\\napparently-useless embellishment like signing commits can have potentially\\nfar-reaching consequences in the future.</p>\\n<p>Git commit signing itself is not particularly consequential.  I have probably\\nspent more time writing this blog post than the sum total of all the time\\nwasted by all programmers configuring their git clients to add useless\\nsignatures; even the relatively modest readership of this blog will likely\\ntransfer more data reading this post than all those signatures will take to\\ntransmit to the various git clients that will read them.  If I just convince\\nyou not to sign your commits, I don’t think I’m coming out ahead in the\\n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Felicific_calculus\">felicific calculus</a> here.</p>\\n<p>What I am actually trying to point out here is that it is useful to <em>carefully\\nconsider how to avoid adding junk complexity to your systems</em>.  One area where\\njunk tends to leak in to designs and to cultures particularly easily is in\\nintimidating subjects like trust and safety, where it is easy to get anxious\\nand convince ourselves that piling on more <em>stuff</em> is safer than leaving things\\nsimple.</p>\\n<p>If I can help you avoid adding even a little bit of unnecessary complexity, I\\nthink it will have been well worth the cost of the writing, and the reading.</p>\\n<h2 id=\"acknowledgments\">Acknowledgments</h2>\\n<p class=\"update-note\">Thank you to <a href=\"https://www.patreon.com/creatorglyph\">my patrons</a> who are\\nsupporting my writing on this blog.

Whether you declare your <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Literal_(computer_programming)\">literal value</a> using a prefix or not, you’ll always end up with a regular Python <code>str</code> object.</p>\\n<p>Other prefixes available at your fingertips, which you can use and sometimes even <a href=\"https://docs.python.org/3/reference/lexical_analysis.html#grammar-token-python-grammar-stringprefix\">mix together</a> in your Python string literals, include:</p>\\n<ul>\\n<li><code>b</code>: Bytes literal</li>\\n<li><code>f</code>: Formatted string literal</li>\\n<li><code>u</code>: Legacy Unicode string literal (<a href=\"https://peps.python.org/pep-0414/\">PEP 414</a>)</li>\\n</ul>\\n<p>Out of those, you might be most familiar with <a href=\"https://realpython.com/python-f-strings/\">f-strings</a>, which let you evaluate expressions inside string literals. Raw strings aren’t as popular as f-strings, but they do have their own uses that can improve your code’s readability.</p>\\n<p>Creating a <a href=\"https://realpython.com/python-strings/\">string of characters</a> is often one of the first skills that you learn when studying a new programming language. The Python Basics <a href=\"https://realpython.com/products/python-basics-book/\">book</a> and <a href=\"https://realpython.com/learning-paths/python-basics/\">learning path</a> cover this topic right at the beginning. With Python, you can define string literals in your source code by delimiting the text with either single quotes (<code>\\'</code>) or double quotes (<code>\"</code>):</p>\\n<div class=\"codeblock mb-3 w-100\">\\n  <div class=\"codeblock__header d-flex justify-content-between codeblock--blue\">\\n    <span class=\"mr-2 noselect\">Python</span>\\n    \\n    <div class=\"noselect\">\\n      \\n        <span class=\"codeblock__output-toggle\" title=\"Toggle prompts and output\"><span class=\"icon baseline js-codeblock-output-on codeblock__header--icon-lower\"></span></span>\\n      \\n    </div>\\n  </div>\\n  <div>\\n    <div class=\"highlight highlight--with-header\"><pre><span></span><code><span class=\"gp\">&gt;&gt;&gt; </span><span class=\"n\">david</span> <span class=\"o\">=</span> <span class=\"s1\">\\'She said \"I love you\" to me.\\'</span>\\n<span class=\"gp\">&gt;&gt;&gt; </span><span class=\"n\">alice</span> <span class=\"o\">=</span> <span class=\"s2\">\"Oh, that\\'s wonderful to hear!\"</span>\\n</code></pre></div>\\n    \\n    <button class=\"codeblock__copy btn btn-outline-secondary border m-1 px-1 d-hover-only\" title=\"Copy to clipboard\"><span class=\"icon baseline\"></span></button>\\n    \\n      <span class=\"small\"><span class=\"icon baseline mr-1 text-success\"></span>Copied!</span>\\n    \\n    \\n  </div>\\n</div>\\n<p>Having such a choice can help you avoid a syntax error when your text includes one of those delimiting characters (<code>\\'</code> or <code>\"</code>). For example, if you need to represent an apostrophe in a string, then you can enclose your text in double quotes. Alternatively, you can use multiline strings to mix both types of delimiters in the text.</p>\\n<p>You may use triple quotes (<code>\\'\\'\\'</code> or <code>\"\"\"</code>) to declare a <strong>multiline string literal</strong> that can accommodate a longer piece of text, such as an excerpt from the <a href=\"https://realpython.com/zen-of-python/\">Zen of Python</a>:</p>\\n<div class=\"codeblock mb-3 w-100\">\\n  <div class=\"codeblock__header d-flex justify-content-between codeblock--blue\">\\n    <span class=\"mr-2 noselect\">Python</span>\\n    \\n    <div class=\"noselect\">\\n      \\n        <span class=\"codeblock__output-toggle\" title=\"Toggle prompts and output\"><span class=\"icon baseline js-codeblock-output-on codeblock__header--icon-lower\"></span></span>\\n      \\n    </div>\\n  </div>\\n  <div>\\n    <div class=\"highlight highlight--with-header\"><pre><span></span><code><span class=\"gp\">&gt;&gt;&gt; </span><span class=\"n\">poem</span> <span class=\"o\">=</span> <span class=\"s2\">\"\"\"</span>\\n<span class=\"gp\">... </span><span class=\"s2\">Beautiful is better than ugly.</span>\\n<span class=\"gp\">... </span><span class=\"s2\">Explicit is better than implicit.</span>\\n<span class=\"gp\">... </span><span class=\"s2\">Simple is better than complex.</span>\\n<span class=\"gp\">... </span><span class=\"s2\">Complex is better than complicated.</span>\\n<span class=\"gp\">... </span><span class=\"s2\">\"\"\"</span>\\n</code></pre></div>\\n    \\n    <button class=\"codeblock__copy btn btn-outline-secondary border m-1 px-1 d-hover-only\" title=\"Copy to clipboard\"><span class=\"icon baseline\"></span></button>\\n    \\n      <span class=\"small\"><span class=\"icon baseline mr-1 text-success\"></span>Copied!</span>\\n    \\n    \\n  </div>\\n</div>\\n<p>Multiline string literals can optionally act as <a href=\"https://realpython.com/documenting-python-code/\">docstrings</a>, a useful form of code documentation in Python.

Whether you declare your <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Literal_(computer_programming)\">literal value</a> using a prefix or not, you’ll always end up with a regular Python <code>str</code> object.</p>\\n<p>Other prefixes available at your fingertips, which you can use and sometimes even <a href=\"https://docs.python.org/3/reference/lexical_analysis.html#grammar-token-python-grammar-stringprefix\">mix together</a> in your Python string literals, include:</p>\\n<ul>\\n<li><code>b</code>: Bytes literal</li>\\n<li><code>f</code>: Formatted string literal</li>\\n<li><code>u</code>: Legacy Unicode string literal (<a href=\"https://peps.python.org/pep-0414/\">PEP 414</a>)</li>\\n</ul>\\n<p>Out of those, you might be most familiar with <a href=\"https://realpython.com/python-f-strings/\">f-strings</a>, which let you evaluate expressions inside string literals. Raw strings aren’t as popular as f-strings, but they do have their own uses that can improve your code’s readability.</p>\\n<p>Creating a <a href=\"https://realpython.com/python-strings/\">string of characters</a> is often one of the first skills that you learn when studying a new programming language. The Python Basics <a href=\"https://realpython.com/products/python-basics-book/\">book</a> and <a href=\"https://realpython.com/learning-paths/python-basics/\">learning path</a> cover this topic right at the beginning. With Python, you can define string literals in your source code by delimiting the text with either single quotes (<code>\\'</code>) or double quotes (<code>\"</code>):</p>\\n<div class=\"codeblock mb-3 w-100\">\\n  <div class=\"codeblock__header d-flex justify-content-between codeblock--blue\">\\n    <span class=\"mr-2 noselect\">Python</span>\\n    \\n    <div class=\"noselect\">\\n      \\n        <span class=\"codeblock__output-toggle\" title=\"Toggle prompts and output\"><span class=\"icon baseline js-codeblock-output-on codeblock__header--icon-lower\"></span></span>\\n      \\n    </div>\\n  </div>\\n  <div>\\n    <div class=\"highlight highlight--with-header\"><pre><span></span><code><span class=\"gp\">&gt;&gt;&gt; </span><span class=\"n\">david</span> <span class=\"o\">=</span> <span class=\"s1\">\\'She said \"I love you\" to me.\\'</span>\\n<span class=\"gp\">&gt;&gt;&gt; </span><span class=\"n\">alice</span> <span class=\"o\">=</span> <span class=\"s2\">\"Oh, that\\'s wonderful to hear!\"</span>\\n</code></pre></div>\\n    \\n    <button class=\"codeblock__copy btn btn-outline-secondary border m-1 px-1 d-hover-only\" title=\"Copy to clipboard\"><span class=\"icon baseline\"></span></button>\\n    \\n      <span class=\"small\"><span class=\"icon baseline mr-1 text-success\"></span>Copied!</span>\\n    \\n    \\n  </div>\\n</div>\\n<p>Having such a choice can help you avoid a syntax error when your text includes one of those delimiting characters (<code>\\'</code> or <code>\"</code>). For example, if you need to represent an apostrophe in a string, then you can enclose your text in double quotes. Alternatively, you can use multiline strings to mix both types of delimiters in the text.</p>\\n<p>You may use triple quotes (<code>\\'\\'\\'</code> or <code>\"\"\"</code>) to declare a <strong>multiline string literal</strong> that can accommodate a longer piece of text, such as an excerpt from the <a href=\"https://realpython.com/zen-of-python/\">Zen of Python</a>:</p>\\n<div class=\"codeblock mb-3 w-100\">\\n  <div class=\"codeblock__header d-flex justify-content-between codeblock--blue\">\\n    <span class=\"mr-2 noselect\">Python</span>\\n    \\n    <div class=\"noselect\">\\n      \\n        <span class=\"codeblock__output-toggle\" title=\"Toggle prompts and output\"><span class=\"icon baseline js-codeblock-output-on codeblock__header--icon-lower\"></span></span>\\n      \\n    </div>\\n  </div>\\n  <div>\\n    <div class=\"highlight highlight--with-header\"><pre><span></span><code><span class=\"gp\">&gt;&gt;&gt; </span><span class=\"n\">poem</span> <span class=\"o\">=</span> <span class=\"s2\">\"\"\"</span>\\n<span class=\"gp\">... </span><span class=\"s2\">Beautiful is better than ugly.</span>\\n<span class=\"gp\">... </span><span class=\"s2\">Explicit is better than implicit.</span>\\n<span class=\"gp\">... </span><span class=\"s2\">Simple is better than complex.</span>\\n<span class=\"gp\">... </span><span class=\"s2\">Complex is better than complicated.</span>\\n<span class=\"gp\">... </span><span class=\"s2\">\"\"\"</span>\\n</code></pre></div>\\n    \\n    <button class=\"codeblock__copy btn btn-outline-secondary border m-1 px-1 d-hover-only\" title=\"Copy to clipboard\"><span class=\"icon baseline\"></span></button>\\n    \\n      <span class=\"small\"><span class=\"icon baseline mr-1 text-success\"></span>Copied!</span>\\n    \\n    \\n  </div>\\n</div>\\n<p>Multiline string literals can optionally act as <a href=\"https://realpython.com/documenting-python-code/\">docstrings</a>, a useful form of code documentation in Python.

C was important because syscalls are defined\\nin terms of C semantics (they are not).  They said it was good for exploring\\nlimited-resource computers like Arduinos, but most people don&#8217;t program for\\nthose. They said it was important because C is more performant, but Python\\nprograms often offload the compute-intensive work to libraries other people have\\nwritten, and these days that work is often on a GPU. Someone said you need it to\\ndebug with strace, then someone said they use strace all the time and don&#8217;t know\\nC.  Someone even said C was good because it explains why NUL isn&#8217;t allowed in\\nfilenames, but who tries to do that, and why learn a language just for that\\ntrivia?</p><p>I&#8217;m all for learning C if it will be useful for the job at hand, but you can\\nwrite lots of great software without knowing C.</p><p>A few people repeated the idea that C teaches you how code &#8220;really&#8221; executes.\\nBut C is an abstract model of a computer, and modern CPUs do all kinds of things\\nthat C doesn&#8217;t show you or explain.  Pipelining, cache misses, branch\\nprediction, speculative execution, multiple cores, even virtual memory are all\\ncompletely invisible to C programs.</p><p>C is an abstraction of how a computer works, and chip makers work hard to\\nimplement that abstraction, but they do it on top of much more complicated\\nmachinery.</p><p>C is far removed from modern computer architectures: there have been 50 years\\nof innovation since it was created in the 1970&#8217;s.  The gap between C&#8217;s model and\\nmodern hardware is the root cause of famous vulnerabilities like Meltdown and\\nSpectre, as explained in\\n<a href=\"https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/3212477.3212479\" rel=\"external noopener\">C is <i>Not</i> a\\nLow-level Language</a>.</p><p>C can teach you useful things, like how memory is a huge array of bytes, but\\nyou can also learn that without writing C programs.  People say, C teaches you\\nabout memory allocation.  Yes it does, but you can learn what that means as a\\nconcept without learning a programming language.  And besides, what will Python\\nor Ruby developers do with that knowledge other than appreciate that their\\nlanguages do that work for them and they no longer have to think about it?</p><p>Pointers came up a lot in the Mastodon replies. Pointers underpin concepts in\\nhigher-level languages, but you can\\n<a href=\"https://nedbatchelder.com/text/names1.html\" rel=\"external noopener\">explain those concepts as\\nreferences</a> instead, and skip pointer arithmetic, aliasing, and null pointers\\ncompletely.</p><p>A question I asked a number of people: what mistakes are\\nJavaScript/Ruby/Python developers making if they don&#8217;t know these things (C,\\nsyscalls, pointers)?&#8221;.  I didn&#8217;t get strong answers.</p><p>We work in an enormous tower of abstractions.  I write programs in Python,\\nwhich provides me abstractions that C (its underlying implementation language)\\ndoes not.  C provides an abstract model of memory and CPU execution which the\\ncomputer implements on top of other mechanisms (microcode and virtual memory).\\nWhen I made a wire-wrapped computer, I could pretend the signal travelled\\nthrough wires instantaneously.  For other hardware designers, that abstraction\\nbreaks down and they need to consider the speed electricity travels.  Sometimes\\nyou need to go one level deeper in the abstraction stack to understand what&#8217;s\\ngoing on. Everyone has to find the right layer to work at.</p><p><a href=\"https://hachyderm.io/@agocke/111791030850237121\" rel=\"external noopener\">Andy Gocke said\\nit well</a>:</p><blockquote><div><p>When you no longer have problems at that layer, that&#8217;s when you can\\nstop caring about that layer. I don&#8217;t think there&#8217;s a universal level of\\nknowledge that people need or is sufficient.</p></div></blockquote><p><a href=\"https://toot.cat/@idlestate/111793957024682587\" rel=\"external noopener\">&#8220;like jam or\\nbootlaces&#8221; made another excellent point</a>:</p><blockquote><div><p>There&#8217;s a big difference between &#8220;everyone should know this&#8221; and\\n&#8220;someone should know this&#8221; that seems to get glossed over in these kinds of\\ndiscussions.</p></div></blockquote><p>C can teach you many useful and interesting things.  It will make you a\\nbetter programmer, just as learning any new-to-you language will because it\\nbroadens your perspective.  Some kinds of programming need C, though other\\nlanguages like Rust are ably filling that role now too.  C doesn&#8217;t teach you how\\na computer really works. It teaches you a common abstraction of how computers\\nwork.</p><p>Find a level of abstraction that works for what you need to do.  When you\\nhave trouble there, look beneath that abstraction. You won&#8217;t be seeing how\\nthings really work, you&#8217;ll be seeing a lower-level abstraction that could be\\nhelpful.  Sometimes what you need will be an abstraction one level up.  Is your\\nPython loop too slow? Perhaps you need a C loop. Or perhaps you need numpy array\\noperations.</p><p>You (probably) don&#8217;t need to learn C.</p>',\n",

Someone even said C was good because it explains why NUL isn&#8217;t allowed in\\nfilenames, but who tries to do that, and why learn a language just for that\\ntrivia?</p><p>I&#8217;m all for learning C if it will be useful for the job at hand, but you can\\nwrite lots of great software without knowing C.</p><p>A few people repeated the idea that C teaches you how code &#8220;really&#8221; executes.\\nBut C is an abstract model of a computer, and modern CPUs do all kinds of things\\nthat C doesn&#8217;t show you or explain.  Pipelining, cache misses, branch\\nprediction, speculative execution, multiple cores, even virtual memory are all\\ncompletely invisible to C programs.</p><p>C is an abstraction of how a computer works, and chip makers work hard to\\nimplement that abstraction, but they do it on top of much more complicated\\nmachinery.</p><p>C is far removed from modern computer architectures: there have been 50 years\\nof innovation since it was created in the 1970&#8217;s.  The gap between C&#8217;s model and\\nmodern hardware is the root cause of famous vulnerabilities like Meltdown and\\nSpectre, as explained in\\n<a href=\"https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/3212477.3212479\" rel=\"external noopener\">C is <i>Not</i> a\\nLow-level Language</a>.</p><p>C can teach you useful things, like how memory is a huge array of bytes, but\\nyou can also learn that without writing C programs.  People say, C teaches you\\nabout memory allocation.  Yes it does, but you can learn what that means as a\\nconcept without learning a programming language.  And besides, what will Python\\nor Ruby developers do with that knowledge other than appreciate that their\\nlanguages do that work for them and they no longer have to think about it?</p><p>Pointers came up a lot in the Mastodon replies. Pointers underpin concepts in\\nhigher-level languages, but you can\\n<a href=\"https://nedbatchelder.com/text/names1.html\" rel=\"external noopener\">explain those concepts as\\nreferences</a> instead, and skip pointer arithmetic, aliasing, and null pointers\\ncompletely.</p><p>A question I asked a number of people: what mistakes are\\nJavaScript/Ruby/Python developers making if they don&#8217;t know these things (C,\\nsyscalls, pointers)?&#8221;.  I didn&#8217;t get strong answers.</p><p>We work in an enormous tower of abstractions.  I write programs in Python,\\nwhich provides me abstractions that C (its underlying implementation language)\\ndoes not.  C provides an abstract model of memory and CPU execution which the\\ncomputer implements on top of other mechanisms (microcode and virtual memory).\\nWhen I made a wire-wrapped computer, I could pretend the signal travelled\\nthrough wires instantaneously.  For other hardware designers, that abstraction\\nbreaks down and they need to consider the speed electricity travels.  Sometimes\\nyou need to go one level deeper in the abstraction stack to understand what&#8217;s\\ngoing on. Everyone has to find the right layer to work at.</p><p><a href=\"https://hachyderm.io/@agocke/111791030850237121\" rel=\"external noopener\">Andy Gocke said\\nit well</a>:</p><blockquote><div><p>When you no longer have problems at that layer, that&#8217;s when you can\\nstop caring about that layer. I don&#8217;t think there&#8217;s a universal level of\\nknowledge that people need or is sufficient.</p></div></blockquote><p><a href=\"https://toot.cat/@idlestate/111793957024682587\" rel=\"external noopener\">&#8220;like jam or\\nbootlaces&#8221; made another excellent point</a>:</p><blockquote><div><p>There&#8217;s a big difference between &#8220;everyone should know this&#8221; and\\n&#8220;someone should know this&#8221; that seems to get glossed over in these kinds of\\ndiscussions.</p></div></blockquote><p>C can teach you many useful and interesting things.  It will make you a\\nbetter programmer, just as learning any new-to-you language will because it\\nbroadens your perspective.  Some kinds of programming need C, though other\\nlanguages like Rust are ably filling that role now too.  C doesn&#8217;t teach you how\\na computer really works. It teaches you a common abstraction of how computers\\nwork.</p><p>Find a level of abstraction that works for what you need to do.  When you\\nhave trouble there, look beneath that abstraction. You won&#8217;t be seeing how\\nthings really work, you&#8217;ll be seeing a lower-level abstraction that could be\\nhelpful.  Sometimes what you need will be an abstraction one level up.  Is your\\nPython loop too slow? Perhaps you need a C loop. Or perhaps you need numpy array\\noperations.</p><p>You (probably) don&#8217;t need to learn C.</p>'},\n",

Massive thank-you to Alpha-Omega for investing in the security of the Python ecosystem!</center>\\n</blockquote>\\n\\n<h2>PEP 740 and open-ended PyPI releases</h2>\\n\\n<p>PEP 740 is a proposal to add support for digital attestations to PyPI artifacts,\\nfor example publish provenance attestations, which can be verified and used by tooling.</p>\\n\\n<p><strong>William Woodruff</strong> has been working on <a href=\"https://github.com/python/peps/pull/3618\">PEP 740</a> which is in draft on GitHub, William addressed my feedback this week.\\nDuring this work the <a href=\"https://github.com/python/peps/pull/3618#discussion_r1453694294\">open-endedness of PyPI releases came up during our discussion</a>, specifically how it\\nis a common gotcha for folks designing tools and policy for multiple software ecosystems difficult.</p>\\n\\n<blockquote>\\n  <p>What does it mean for PyPI releases to be <em>open-ended?</em> It means that you can always upload new files\\n  to an existing release on PyPI even if the release has been created for years. This is because a PyPI\\n  “release” is only a thin layer aggregating a bunch of files on PyPI that happen to share the same version.</p>\\n</blockquote>\\n\\n<p>This discussion between us was opened up as a <a href=\"https://discuss.python.org/t/restricting-open-ended-releases-on-pypi/43566\">wider discussion on discuss.python.org</a> about this property. Summarizing this discussion:</p>\\n\\n<ul>\\n<li>New Python releases mean new wheels need to be built for non-ABI3 compatible projects.

This is because a PyPI\\n  “release” is only a thin layer aggregating a bunch of files on PyPI that happen to share the same version.</p>\\n</blockquote>\\n\\n<p>This discussion between us was opened up as a <a href=\"https://discuss.python.org/t/restricting-open-ended-releases-on-pypi/43566\">wider discussion on discuss.python.org</a> about this property.

To recap, Nuitka package\\nconfiguration is the way Nuitka learns about hidden dependencies, needed\\nDLLs, data files, and just generally avoids bloat in the compilation.\\nThe details are here on a dedicate page on the web site in <a class=\"reference external\" href=\"https://nuitka.net/doc/nuitka-package-config.html\">Nuitka\\nPackage Configuration</a> but reading on\\nwill be just fine.</p>\\n\\n\\n<h1>Problem Package</h1>\\n<p>Each post will feature one package that caused a particular problem. In\\nthis case, we are talking about the package <code class=\"docutils literal notranslate\"><span class=\"pre\">toga</span></code>.</p>\\n<p>Problems like with this package are typically encountered in standalone\\nmode only, but they also affect accelerated mode, since it doesn’t\\ncompile all the things desired in that case. Some packages, and in this\\ninstance look at what OS they are running on, environment variables,\\netc. and then in a relatively static fashion, but one that Nuitka cannot\\nsee through, loads a what it calls “backend” module.</p>\\n<p>We are going to look at that in some detail, and will see a workaround\\napplied with the <code class=\"docutils literal notranslate\"><span class=\"pre\">anti-bloat</span></code> engine doing code modification on the\\nfly that make the choice determined at compile time, and visible to\\nNuitka is this way.</p>\\n\\n\\n<h1>Initial Symptom</h1>\\n<p>The initial symptom reported was that <code class=\"docutils literal notranslate\"><span class=\"pre\">toga</span></code> did suffer from broken\\nversion lookups and therefor did not work, and we encountered even two\\nthings, that prevented it, one was about the version number. It was\\ntrying to do <code class=\"docutils literal notranslate\"><span class=\"pre\">int</span></code> after resolving the version of toga by itself to\\n<code class=\"docutils literal

runtime lookup your own version number. The use of <code class=\"docutils literal notranslate\"><span class=\"pre\">setuptools_scm</span></code>\\nis implying the use of setuptools, for which the version cannot be\\ndetermined, and that’s crashing.</p>\\n\\n\\n<h1>Step 1 - Analysis of initial crashing</h1>\\n<p>So first thing, we did was to repair <code class=\"docutils literal notranslate\"><span class=\"pre\">setuptools</span></code>, to know its\\nversion. It is doing it a bit different, because it cannot use itself.\\nOur compile time optimization failed there, but also would be overkill.\\nWe never came across this, since we avoid <code class=\"docutils literal notranslate\"><span class=\"pre\">setuptools</span></code> very hard\\nnormally, but it’s not good to be incompatible.</p>\\n<div class=\"highlight-yaml notranslate\"><div class=\"highlight\"><pre><span></span><span class=\"p p-Indicator\">-</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"nt\">module-name</span><span class=\"p\">:</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"s\">\\'setuptools.version\\'</span>\\n<span class=\"w\">  </span><span class=\"nt\">anti-bloat</span><span class=\"p\">:</span>\\n<span class=\"w\">    </span><span class=\"p p-Indicator\">-</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"nt\">description</span><span class=\"p\">:</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"s\">\\'workaround</span><span class=\"nv\"> </span><span class=\"s\">for</span><span class=\"nv\"> </span><span class=\"s\">metadata</span><span class=\"nv\"> </span><span class=\"s\">version</span><span class=\"nv\"> </span><span class=\"s\">of</span><span class=\"nv\"> </span><span class=\"s\">setuptools\\'</span>\\n<span class=\"w\">      </span><span class=\"nt\">replacements</span><span class=\"p\">:</span>\\n<span class=\"w\">        </span><span class=\"s\">&quot;pkg_resources.get_distribution(\\'setuptools\\').version&quot;</span><span class=\"p p-Indicator\">:</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"s\">&quot;repr(__import__(\\'setuptools.version\\').version.__version__)&quot;</span>\\n</pre></div>\\n</div>\\n<p>We do not have to include all metadata for <code class=\"docutils literal notranslate\"><span class=\"pre\">setuptools</span></code> here, just to\\nget that one item, so we chose to make a simple string replacement here,\\nthat just looks the value up at compile time and puts it into the source\\ncode automatically. That removes the\\n<code class=\"docutils literal notranslate\"><span class=\"pre\">pkg_resources.get_distribution()</span></code> call entirely.</p>\\n<p>With that, <code class=\"docutils literal notranslate\"><span class=\"pre\">setuptools_scm</span></code> was not crashing anymore. That’s good. But\\nwe don’t really want it to be included, since it’s good for dynamically\\ndetecting the version from git, and what not, but including the\\nframework for building C extensions, not a good idea in the general\\ncase. Nuitka therefore said this:</p>\\n<div class=\"highlight-default notranslate\"><div class=\"highlight\"><pre><span></span>Nuitka-Plugins:WARNING: anti-bloat: Undesirable import of \\'setuptools_scm\\' (intending to\\nNuitka-Plugins:WARNING: avoid \\'setuptools\\') in \\'toga\\' (at\\nNuitka-Plugins:WARNING: \\'c:\\\\3\\\\Lib\\\\site-packages\\\\toga\\\\__init__.py:99\\') encountered.

In that way, the\\nimport still happens if some other part of the code imports the module,\\nbut only then. We no longer enforce the non-usage of a module here, we\\njust make that decision based on other uses being present.</p>\\n<p>With this the bloat warning, and the inclusion of <code class=\"docutils literal notranslate\"><span class=\"pre\">setuptools_scm</span></code>\\ninto the compilation is removed, and you always want to make as small as\\npossible and remove those packages that do not contribute anything but\\noverhead, aka bloat.</p>\\n<p>The next thing discovered was that <code class=\"docutils literal notranslate\"><span class=\"pre\">toga</span></code> needs the <code class=\"docutils literal notranslate\"><span class=\"pre\">toga-core</span></code>\\ndistribution to version check. For that, we use the common solution, and\\ntell that we want to include the metadata of it, for when <code class=\"docutils literal notranslate\"><span class=\"pre\">toga</span></code> is\\npart of a compilation.</p>\\n<div class=\"highlight-yaml notranslate\"><div class=\"highlight\"><pre><span></span><span class=\"p p-Indicator\">-</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"nt\">module-name</span><span class=\"p\">:</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"s\">\\'toga\\'</span>\\n<span class=\"w\">  </span><span class=\"nt\">data-files</span><span class=\"p\">:</span>\\n<span class=\"w\">    </span><span class=\"nt\">include-metadata</span><span class=\"p\">:</span>\\n<span class=\"w\">      </span><span class=\"p p-Indicator\">-</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"s\">\\'toga-core\\'</span>\\n</pre></div>\\n</div>\\n<p>So that moved the entire issue of version looks to resolved.</p>\\n\\n\\n<h1>Step 2 - Dynamic Backend dependency</h1>\\n<p>Now on to the backend issue. What remained was a need for including the\\nplatform specific backend. One that can even be overridden by an\\nenvironment variable. For full compatibility, we invented something new.\\nTypically what we would have done is to create a toga plugin for the\\nfollowing snippet.</p>\\n<div class=\"highlight-yaml notranslate\"><div class=\"highlight\"><pre><span></span><span class=\"p p-Indicator\">-</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"nt\">module-name</span><span class=\"p\">:</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"s\">\\'toga.platform\\'</span>\\n<span class=\"w\">  </span><span class=\"nt\">variables</span><span class=\"p\">:</span>\\n<span class=\"w\">    </span><span class=\"nt\">setup_code</span><span class=\"p\">:</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"s\">\\'import</span><span class=\"nv\"> </span><span class=\"s\">toga.platform\\'</span>\\n<span class=\"w\">    </span><span class=\"nt\">declarations</span><span class=\"p\">:</span>\\n<span class=\"w\">      </span><span class=\"s\">\\'toga_backend_module_name\\'</span><span class=\"p p-Indicator\">:</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"s\">\\'toga.platform.get_platform_factory().__name__\\'</span>\\n<span class=\"w\">  </span><span class=\"nt\">anti-bloat</span><span class=\"p\">:</span>\\n<span class=\"w\">    </span><span class=\"p p-Indicator\">-</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"nt\">change_function</span><span class=\"p\">:</span>\\n<span class=\"w\">        </span><span class=\"s\">\\'get_platform_factory\\'</span><span class=\"p p-Indicator\">:</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"s\">&quot;\\'importlib.import_module(%r)\\'</span><span class=\"nv\"> </span><span class=\"s\">%</span><span class=\"nv\"> </span><span class=\"s\">get_variable(\\'toga_backend_module_name\\')&quot;</span>\\n</pre></div>\\n</div>\\n<p>There is a whole new thing here, a new feature that was added\\nspecifically for this to be easy to do. And with the backend selection\\nbeing complex and partially dynamic code, we didn’t want to hard code\\nthat. So we added support for <code class=\"docutils literal notranslate\"><span class=\"pre\">variables</span></code> and their use in Nuitka\\nPackage Configuration.</p>\\n<p>The first block <code class=\"docutils literal notranslate\"><span class=\"pre\">variables</span></code> defines a mapping of expressions in\\n<code class=\"docutils literal notranslate\"><span class=\"pre\">declarations</span></code> that will be evaluated at compile time given the setup\\ncode under <code class=\"docutils literal notranslate\"><span class=\"pre\">setup_code</span></code>.</p>\\n<p>This then allows us to have a variable with the name of the backend that\\n<code class=\"docutils literal notranslate\"><span class=\"pre\">toga</span></code> decides to use. We then change the very complex function\\n<code class=\"docutils literal notranslate\"><span class=\"pre\">get_platform_factory</span></code> that we used used, for compilation, to be\\nreplacement that Nuitka will be able to statically optimize and see the\\nbackend as a dependency and use it directly at run time, which is what\\nwe want.</p>\\n\\n\\n<h1>Final remarks</h1>\\n<p>I am hoping you will find this very helpful information and will join\\nthe effort to make packaging for Python work out of the box. Adding\\nsupport for <code class=\"docutils literal notranslate\"><span class=\"pre\">toga</span></code> was a bit more complex, but with the new tool, once\\nidentified to be that kind of backend issue, it might have become a lot\\nmore easy.</p>\\n<p>Lessons learned. We should cover packages that we routinely remove from\\ncompilation, like setuptools, but e.g. also IPython. This will have to\\nadded, such that <code class=\"docutils literal notranslate\"><span class=\"pre\">setuptools_scm</span></code> cannot cloud the vision to actual\\nissues.</p>',\n",

In\\nthis case, we are talking about the package <code class=\"docutils literal notranslate\"><span class=\"pre\">toga</span></code>.</p>\\n<p>Problems like with this package are typically encountered in standalone\\nmode only, but they also affect accelerated mode, since it doesn’t\\ncompile all the things desired in that case. Some packages, and in this\\ninstance look at what OS they are running on, environment variables,\\netc. and then in a relatively static fashion, but one that Nuitka cannot\\nsee through, loads a what it calls “backend” module.</p>\\n<p>We are going to look at that in some detail, and will see a workaround\\napplied with the <code class=\"docutils literal notranslate\"><span class=\"pre\">anti-bloat</span></code> engine doing code modification on the\\nfly that make the choice determined at compile time, and visible to\\nNuitka is this way.</p>\\n\\n\\n<h1>Initial Symptom</h1>\\n<p>The initial symptom reported was that <code class=\"docutils literal notranslate\"><span class=\"pre\">toga</span></code> did suffer from broken\\nversion lookups and therefor did not work, and we encountered even two\\nthings, that prevented it, one was about the version number. It was\\ntrying to do <code class=\"docutils literal notranslate\"><span class=\"pre\">int</span></code> after resolving the version of toga by itself to\\n<code class=\"docutils literal

runtime lookup your own version number. The use of <code class=\"docutils literal notranslate\"><span class=\"pre\">setuptools_scm</span></code>\\nis implying the use of setuptools, for which the version cannot be\\ndetermined, and that’s crashing.</p>\\n\\n\\n<h1>Step 1 - Analysis of initial crashing</h1>\\n<p>So first thing, we did was to repair <code class=\"docutils literal notranslate\"><span class=\"pre\">setuptools</span></code>, to know its\\nversion. It is doing it a bit different, because it cannot use itself.\\nOur compile time optimization failed there, but also would be overkill.\\nWe never came across this, since we avoid <code class=\"docutils literal notranslate\"><span class=\"pre\">setuptools</span></code> very hard\\nnormally, but it’s not good to be incompatible.</p>\\n<div class=\"highlight-yaml notranslate\"><div class=\"highlight\"><pre><span></span><span class=\"p p-Indicator\">-</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"nt\">module-name</span><span class=\"p\">:</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"s\">\\'setuptools.version\\'</span>\\n<span class=\"w\">  </span><span class=\"nt\">anti-bloat</span><span class=\"p\">:</span>\\n<span class=\"w\">    </span><span class=\"p p-Indicator\">-</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"nt\">description</span><span class=\"p\">:</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"s\">\\'workaround</span><span class=\"nv\"> </span><span class=\"s\">for</span><span class=\"nv\"> </span><span class=\"s\">metadata</span><span class=\"nv\"> </span><span class=\"s\">version</span><span class=\"nv\"> </span><span class=\"s\">of</span><span class=\"nv\"> </span><span class=\"s\">setuptools\\'</span>\\n<span class=\"w\">      </span><span class=\"nt\">replacements</span><span class=\"p\">:</span>\\n<span class=\"w\">        </span><span class=\"s\">&quot;pkg_resources.get_distribution(\\'setuptools\\').version&quot;</span><span class=\"p p-Indicator\">:</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"s\">&quot;repr(__import__(\\'setuptools.version\\').version.__version__)&quot;</span>\\n</pre></div>\\n</div>\\n<p>We do not have to include all metadata for <code class=\"docutils literal notranslate\"><span class=\"pre\">setuptools</span></code> here, just to\\nget that one item, so we chose to make a simple string replacement here,\\nthat just looks the value up at compile time and puts it into the source\\ncode automatically. That removes the\\n<code class=\"docutils literal notranslate\"><span class=\"pre\">pkg_resources.get_distribution()</span></code> call entirely.</p>\\n<p>With that, <code class=\"docutils literal notranslate\"><span class=\"pre\">setuptools_scm</span></code> was not crashing anymore. That’s good. But\\nwe don’t really want it to be included, since it’s good for dynamically\\ndetecting the version from git, and what not, but including the\\nframework for building C extensions, not a good idea in the general\\ncase. Nuitka therefore said this:</p>\\n<div class=\"highlight-default notranslate\"><div class=\"highlight\"><pre><span></span>Nuitka-Plugins:WARNING: anti-bloat: Undesirable import of \\'setuptools_scm\\' (intending to\\nNuitka-Plugins:WARNING: avoid \\'setuptools\\') in \\'toga\\' (at\\nNuitka-Plugins:WARNING: \\'c:\\\\3\\\\Lib\\\\site-packages\\\\toga\\\\__init__.py:99\\') encountered.

More information can be found at\\nNuitka-Plugins:WARNING: https://nuitka.net/info/unwanted-module.html\\n</pre></div>\\n</div>\\n<p>So that’s informing the user to take action. And in the case of optional\\nimports, i.e. ones where using code will handle the <code class=\"docutils literal notranslate\"><span class=\"pre\">ImportError</span></code> just\\nfine and work without it, we can use do this.</p>\\n<div class=\"highlight-yaml notranslate\"><div class=\"highlight\"><pre><span></span><span class=\"p p-Indicator\">-</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"nt\">module-name</span><span class=\"p\">:</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"s\">\\'toga\\'</span>\\n<span class=\"w\">  </span><span class=\"nt\">anti-bloat</span><span class=\"p\">:</span>\\n<span class=\"w\">    </span><span class=\"p p-Indicator\">-</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"nt\">description</span><span class=\"p\">:</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"s\">\\'remove</span><span class=\"nv\"> </span><span class=\"s\">setuptools</span><span class=\"nv\"> </span><span class=\"s\">usage\\'</span>\\n<span class=\"w\">      </span><span class=\"nt\">no-auto-follow</span><span class=\"p\">:</span>\\n<span class=\"w\">        </span><span class=\"s\">\\'setuptools_scm\\'</span><span class=\"p p-Indicator\">:</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"s\">\\'\\'</span>\\n<span class=\"w\">      </span><span class=\"nt\">when</span><span class=\"p\">:</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"s\">\\'not</span><span class=\"nv\"> </span><span class=\"s\">use_setuptools\\'</span>\\n</pre></div>\\n</div>\\n<p>He we say, no <strong>not</strong> automatically follow <code class=\"docutils literal notranslate\"><span class=\"pre\">setuptools_scm</span></code> reports,\\n<strong>unless</strong> there is other code that still does it. In that way, the\\nimport still happens if some other part of the code imports the module,\\nbut only then. We no longer enforce the non-usage of a module here, we\\njust make that decision based on other uses being present.</p>\\n<p>With this the bloat warning, and the inclusion of <code class=\"docutils literal notranslate\"><span class=\"pre\">setuptools_scm</span></code>\\ninto the compilation is removed, and you always want to make as small as\\npossible and remove those packages that do not contribute anything but\\noverhead, aka bloat.</p>\\n<p>The next thing discovered was that <code class=\"docutils literal notranslate\"><span class=\"pre\">toga</span></code> needs the <code class=\"docutils literal notranslate\"><span class=\"pre\">toga-core</span></code>\\ndistribution to version check. For that, we use the common solution, and\\ntell that we want to include the metadata of it, for when <code class=\"docutils literal notranslate\"><span class=\"pre\">toga</span></code> is\\npart of a compilation.</p>\\n<div class=\"highlight-yaml notranslate\"><div class=\"highlight\"><pre><span></span><span class=\"p p-Indicator\">-</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"nt\">module-name</span><span class=\"p\">:</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"s\">\\'toga\\'</span>\\n<span class=\"w\">  </span><span class=\"nt\">data-files</span><span class=\"p\">:</span>\\n<span class=\"w\">    </span><span class=\"nt\">include-metadata</span><span class=\"p\">:</span>\\n<span class=\"w\">      </span><span class=\"p p-Indicator\">-</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"s\">\\'toga-core\\'</span>\\n</pre></div>\\n</div>\\n<p>So that moved the entire issue of version looks to resolved.</p>\\n\\n\\n<h1>Step 2 - Dynamic Backend dependency</h1>\\n<p>Now on to the backend issue. What remained was a need for including the\\nplatform specific backend. One that can even be overridden by an\\nenvironment variable. For full compatibility, we invented something new.\\nTypically what we would have done is to create a toga plugin for the\\nfollowing snippet.</p>\\n<div class=\"highlight-yaml notranslate\"><div class=\"highlight\"><pre><span></span><span class=\"p p-Indicator\">-</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"nt\">module-name</span><span class=\"p\">:</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"s\">\\'toga.platform\\'</span>\\n<span class=\"w\">  </span><span class=\"nt\">variables</span><span class=\"p\">:</span>\\n<span class=\"w\">    </span><span class=\"nt\">setup_code</span><span class=\"p\">:</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"s\">\\'import</span><span class=\"nv\"> </span><span class=\"s\">toga.platform\\'</span>\\n<span class=\"w\">    </span><span class=\"nt\">declarations</span><span class=\"p\">:</span>\\n<span class=\"w\">      </span><span class=\"s\">\\'toga_backend_module_name\\'</span><span class=\"p p-Indicator\">:</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"s\">\\'toga.platform.get_platform_factory().__name__\\'</span>\\n<span class=\"w\">  </span><span class=\"nt\">anti-bloat</span><span class=\"p\">:</span>\\n<span class=\"w\">    </span><span class=\"p p-Indicator\">-</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"nt\">change_function</span><span class=\"p\">:</span>\\n<span class=\"w\">        </span><span class=\"s\">\\'get_platform_factory\\'</span><span class=\"p p-Indicator\">:</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"s\">&quot;\\'importlib.import_module(%r)\\'</span><span class=\"nv\"> </span><span class=\"s\">%</span><span class=\"nv\"> </span><span class=\"s\">get_variable(\\'toga_backend_module_name\\')&quot;</span>\\n</pre></div>\\n</div>\\n<p>There is a whole new thing here, a new feature that was added\\nspecifically for this to be easy to do. And with the backend selection\\nbeing complex and partially dynamic code, we didn’t want to hard code\\nthat. So we added support for <code class=\"docutils literal notranslate\"><span class=\"pre\">variables</span></code> and their use in Nuitka\\nPackage Configuration.</p>\\n<p>The first block <code class=\"docutils literal notranslate\"><span class=\"pre\">variables</span></code> defines a mapping of expressions in\\n<code class=\"docutils literal notranslate\"><span class=\"pre\">declarations</span></code> that will be evaluated at compile time given the setup\\ncode under <code class=\"docutils literal notranslate\"><span class=\"pre\">setup_code</span></code>.</p>\\n<p>This then allows us to have a variable with the name of the backend that\\n<code class=\"docutils literal notranslate\"><span class=\"pre\">toga</span></code> decides to use. We then change the very complex function\\n<code class=\"docutils literal notranslate\"><span class=\"pre\">get_platform_factory</span></code> that we used used, for compilation, to be\\nreplacement that Nuitka will be able to statically optimize and see the\\nbackend as a dependency and use it directly at run time, which is what\\nwe want.</p>\\n\\n\\n<h1>Final remarks</h1>\\n<p>I am hoping you will find this very helpful information and will join\\nthe effort to make packaging for Python work out of the box. Adding\\nsupport for <code class=\"docutils literal notranslate\"><span class=\"pre\">toga</span></code> was a bit more complex, but with the new tool, once\\nidentified to be that kind of backend issue, it might have become a lot\\nmore easy.</p>\\n<p>Lessons learned. We should cover packages that we routinely remove from\\ncompilation, like setuptools, but e.g. also IPython. This will have to\\nadded, such that <code class=\"docutils literal notranslate\"><span class=\"pre\">setuptools_scm</span></code> cannot cloud the vision to actual\\nissues.</p>'},\n",

Most folks don\\'t get\\npaid to work on open source for their first project, so <em>it\\'s unlikely to be their initial motivation</em>.</p>\\n\\n<p>Recognition is typically what feels “at stake” when removing a previous maintainer from operational roles on an open source project.</p>\\n\\n<p>Let\\'s split recognition into another two categories: <strong>operational</strong> and <strong>celebratory</strong>.

Most folks don\\'t get\\npaid to work on open source for their first project, so <em>it\\'s unlikely to be their initial motivation</em>.</p>\\n\\n<p>Recognition is typically what feels “at stake” when removing a previous maintainer from operational roles on an open source project.</p>\\n\\n<p>Let\\'s split recognition into another two categories: <strong>operational</strong> and <strong>celebratory</strong>.
